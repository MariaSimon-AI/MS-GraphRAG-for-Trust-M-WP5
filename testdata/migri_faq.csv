"23.10.2024";"https://migri.fi/en/faq-family";"May my parents be granted a Finnish residence permit?";"Relatives other than members of the nuclear family may in some cases be granted a residence permit on the basis of family ties. The permit may be granted only to other relatives of a Finnish citizen or a person who has received international protection.

If the close family life of the applicant and of the relative living in Finland has previously been discontinued for normal family reasons – for example, when an adult child has begun family life with his or her spouse – the residence permit may not be granted on the grounds of resuming close family life.

Residence permits are primarily intended to be granted on the above grounds if an elderly parent moves to Finland at the same time as his or her adult child. If the application for a residence permit is submitted after the adult child has moved to Finland, the discontinuation of family life must have taken place for compelling reasons, such as for living in exile as a refugee. Even in such cases the efforts to resume the close family life must begin immediately after the adult child has arrived in Finland and established contact with the relative.

A permit may also be granted if the close relative is fully dependent on the person residing in Finland. Dependence on a person (sponsor) residing in Finland refers to both physical and mental dependence; financial dependence alone does not constitute full dependence.

Those falling within this group generally include the elderly parents of adults residing in Finland as well as adult children and unmarried siblings. Residence permits are not generally granted on the basis of poor health and need for treatment if the applicant has the opportunity to receive treatment for his or her condition in the home country.

If the applicant’s poor health is stated as a reason for the application, relevant medical certificates must be appended to the application.";"";""

Another reason for interviewing children who apply for asylum together with their family is that the children may also have their own grounds for asylum.

Under the Aliens Act, the Finnish Immigration Service has an obligation to hear all children over the age of 12 before making a decision that affects them.

In asylum matters, interview is the most important method to find out what a person has to say about their situation.

Children are interviewed in the presence of their parents, and the parents can participate in the discussion. In addition to the child and his or her parents, there is also an interpreter and a Finnish Immigration Service employee present at the interview. The Finnish Immigration Service uses trained employees who are specialised in interviewing children.

The best interests of a child are assessed individually on a case-by-case basis. When a decision is made, the overall situation of the child is taken into account. This includes the child’s personal background, situation and needs.

When a best interests assessment is made, several viewpoints are taken into account. The primary criterion is security. A child’s grounds for international protection may be stronger than an adult’s. Children may also have their own grounds for asylum independently of their parents. There are also forms of persecution that only affect children. All this, together with the security situation in the child’s home region, is taken into account in asylum decisions.

When a child’s best interests are assessed, we take into account the child’s family ties and other close relationships as well as the child’s religious, linguistic and cultural background. Also any individual needs concerning, for instance, the child’s development or health are taken into account.";"";""

Conversion to Christianity may affect a child's daily life in Finland even when he or she is young. The child may, for instance, have participated in church activities.

Naturally, children may be in risk of facing persecution because of other reasons as well. Sometimes, however, these events may have affected the parents in their home country or a long time ago. In such cases, it may not be necessary to interview the children.";"religion";""
"23.10.2024";"https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children";"What is a child able to tell about his or her situation?";"Interviewing a child is necessary if the matter in question affects the child and if the child can be assumed to have information about the matter.

In the hearing, the child can be asked for instance about what it means to him or her to be a member of a Christian congregation and what the child’s own opinion about this is.

The purpose of asking such questions is to gather additional information about how the child is in risk of persecution. However, the aim is not to use the child's statement against the family. A child’s statement alone cannot determine whether the family is granted asylum or not.

The system uses these rules to check whether your application meets the requirements laid down in law.

"23.10.2024";"https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation";"How does automation work?";"We take advantage of automation in decision-making and in the processing of applications. For example, applications are automatically directed to different processing paths, which makes the processing more efficient and improves customer service. In addition to automation, the processing of applications and decision-making involve steps taken by authorities.

Automation is based on the rules formulated by the Finnish Immigration Service. These rules are based on law. The system uses these rules to check whether your application meets the requirements laid down in law. Automated decision-making does not use artificial intelligence.";"";""
"23.10.2024";"https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation";"You have mentioned earlier that you are using automation. How does the now implemented automated processing differ from the automation used earlier?";"So-called assistive automation has been in use at the Finnish Immigration Service for several years. Assistive automation means that a set of automated rules has been established to help officials verify that an application meets the necessary requirements applicable to the permit in question. A requirement may be automatically marked as met if there is no need for our specialist to assess it. If discretion must be exercised, the requirement is directed to our specialist for examination. Once all the requirements for the application have been met, a draft decision is automatically generated. The draft decision is then validated by our specialist. 

Even though this type of assistive automation has been in use for several years, introducing fully automated decisions has not previously been possible due to a lack of general legislation on the matter. Now that the current legislation allows automated decisions, the Finnish Immigration Service will gradually start identifying standard cases in different permit processes in which automated decisions could be issued. Standard cases are applications that in the authority’s estimation must always be decided on in the same way.";"";""

"23.10.2024";"https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation";"Can a member of my family receive an automated decision?";"Under law, family members cannot receive an automated decision. Therefore, automated decisions are not given to the applicants who apply for a permit at the same time as their family members.
However, we take account of the family members who are applying for a permit at the same time as the main applicant and try to issue decisions for them at the same time.";"";""
"23.10.2024";"https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation";"Why can’t all students get automated decisions?";"We introduce automated decisions in stages. We first start using automated decision-making in the case of degree students at universities and exchange students in all educational institutions, because their applications rarely require individual assessment.
We aim to expand the use of automated decision-making to other standard cases among students’ applications.

University students account for approximately 25 % of all students annually coming to Finland. When some of the students receive an automated decision, our specialists can focus their time on the processing of other applications. This way, automated decisions will shorten the processing times of applications from other students as well.";"";""

An application can be decided on automatically only if the application does not require case-by-case discretion, such as granting an exception to a requirement. A requirement is not met automatically if, for instance, we do not receive all the information from another authority’s register that would be necessary for confirming that the requirements are met. In such a case, an official must examine the matter and assess whether or not the requirement is met. This means that an automated decision is not possible. ";"";""

The automation only concerns the way a decision is created and does not have a direct impact on how quickly an application moves from the queue to being processed. For this reason, it is likely that you would not receive a decision any sooner even if you submitted a new application.";"";""

Show the police or the border control authority your identity document, such as a biometric passport issued by your country of nationality, or a Ukrainian internal passport.
The police or border control authority registers your application for temporary protection and makes a record of
your personal details and place of residence

You will also need to provide a photo, fingerprints and a signature.
The police or border control authority will ask you whether you wish to apply for temporary protection only, or if you would also like to submit an application for asylum.
The differences between temporary protection and asylum will be explained to you, so that you can make an informed decision. You may also apply for asylum at a later date.
Following registration, the Finnish Immigration Service makes a decision on your application.
Making the decision requires an identity document, such as a biometric passport issued by your country of nationality, or a Ukrainian internal passport. If you do not have an identity document, apply for one at the embassy of Ukraine in Finland. Tell the embassy that you have applied for temporary protection and that you need an identity document for the application. Please note that the passports of Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic are not approved travel documents in Finland because Finland has not recognised the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk. 
If you have applied for asylum in addition to temporary protection, you are not required to obtain an identity document from the authorities of your home country.
You will be heard before the decision is made only if the Finnish Immigration Service considers there to be a particular reason to do so.
You will receive a copy of the decision. 
The Finnish Immigration Service will send you a copy of the decision by post. The decision will be sent to the reception centre in which you are staying. If you are staying in private accommodation, the decision will be sent to your address in Finland. It is therefore important that you let the reception centre at which you are registered know about any changes of address without delay.
If you do not receive a copy of the decision by post, you will be invited to hear it in person at the Finnish Immigration Service or the police.

We have been contacted by many people with offers for accommodation facilities. In March 2022, we asked the Finnish Red Cross to help us sort out these offers and other offers for help.

During the past six months, the Finnish Red Cross has been contacted nearly 3,600 times in connection with offers for help. However, the number of people contacting us has decreased steadily in the past few months, and for that reason, the national-level coordination assignment of the Finnish Red Cross was ended on 31 August 2022.

One way to help is to contact reliable volunteer organisations. ";"Finnish Red Cross";"I'm citizen of Ukraine and I have a question related to Russia's attack on Ukraine"
"23.10.2024";"https://migri.fi/en/faq-ukraine";"I can accommodate Ukrainians in my own home or apartment. What things should I know?";"People applying for asylum or temporary protection are always able to stay at a reception centre. However, people applying for asylum or temporary protection can also organise accommodation by themselves. This is called private accommodation. Usually this means staying with one’s relatives, spouse or friends. Private accommodation can mean living in a rented or sublet apartment. Asylum seekers can also live in a private person’s home  (home accommodation), which is free of charge. The accommodation facility must be appropriate for living purposes, and it must have an official address. An asylum seeker living in private accommodation will be registered at the nearest reception centre. The reception centre where the persons arranging their accommodation themselves are registered at provides them reception services, with the exception of accommodation and possible meals. Living in or arranging private accommodation is not financially supported.

A person who is under the age of 18 and who has arrived in Finland alone to apply for asylum or temporary protection will be accommodated at a reception centre for children, which is also called a unit for minors. A child who has come to Finland to apply for asylum with his or her relatives can also stay with them at a reception centre. An unaccompanied minor applying for asylum in Finland can be transferred to private accommodation, if it is evaluated to be in the best interest of the child. The person providing accommodation must be able to secure the daily maintenance, upbringing and other care of the child, taking into account the child’s age and stage of development.

After a statement on private accommodation has been made, the director of the reception centre makes a decision in the matter. The wish to transfer a child to private accommodation can be expressed by a person offering private accommodation, a child wishing to move to private accommodation, or the child’s representative. The representative assigned to a child cannot be the person offering the child private accommodation. Living in or arranging private accommodation is not financially supported.

Children who arrive in Finland with their relatives may live in a reception centre together with the relatives who also apply for asylum or temporary protection. A child who applies for asylum or temporary protection in Finland without his or her parent or guardian can be moved to private accommodation if this is deemed to be in the best interests of the child.  The person with whom the child will live must be able to secure the care and upbringing necessary for the child, taking into account the child’s age and level of development. 

First, a statement on private accommodation is prepared. After that, the director of the reception centre will make a decision on moving the child to private accommodation. A wish to transfer a child to private accommodation can be expressed to the unit for minors by the child herself, by a representative of the child, or by the person offering the child private accommodation. The representative assigned to the child cannot be the same person as the person who offers the child private accommodation.

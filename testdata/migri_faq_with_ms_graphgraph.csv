2. Contact the service point: If there are no available appointments for an extended period, consider contacting the service point directly to inquire about alternative options.

5. Be patient and persistent: Sometimes it takes time to find the right appointment. Keep trying and don't give up!

6. Utilize online resources: Websites like Zocdoc, Healthcare Bluebook, or RateMDs can help you find available appointments with healthcare providers in your area.

7. Ask for recommendations: Reach out to friends, family, or colleagues who may have had positive experiences with service providers and can recommend someone with availability.

8. Offer a different day or time: If you're flexible with the day or time of your appointment, let the service provider know so they can accommodate you if possible.

9. Consider telemedicine appointments: For non-emergency situations, virtual consultations may be an option to discuss your issue and receive guidance until you can secure a face-to-face appointment.

10. Keep organized: Maintain a calendar or list of potential appointments so you can easily track availability and make informed decisions about which one to choose when a slot becomes available."

If the close family life of the applicant and of the relative living in Finland has previously been discontinued for normal family reasons – for example, when an adult child has begun family life with his or her spouse – the residence permit may not be granted on the grounds of resuming close family life.

Residence permits are primarily intended to be granted on the above grounds if an elderly parent moves to Finland at the same time as his or her adult child. If the application for a residence permit is submitted after the adult child has moved to Finland, the discontinuation of family life must have taken place for compelling reasons, such as for living in exile as a refugee.

A permit may also be granted if the close relative is fully dependent on the person residing in Finland. Dependence on a person (sponsor) residing in Finland refers to both physical and mental dependence; financial dependence alone does not constitute full dependence.

Those falling within this group generally include the elderly parents of adults residing in Finland as well as adult children and unmarried siblings. Residence permits are not generally granted on the basis of poor health and need for treatment if the applicant has the opportunity to receive treatment for his or her condition in the home country.

If the applicant’s poor health is stated as a reason for the application, relevant medical certificates must be appended to the application.";;;"To apply for a Finnish residence permit, your parents would need to meet the requirements set by the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri).

It makes no difference what kind of residence permit their spouses have in Finland (for example a residence permit for studies or for an employed person). The income level requirement is based on how much money a person must have at his or her disposal in order to be able to finance his or her stay in Finland. The required income level is lower for students than for other applicants. It is based on the financial aid that Finnish students receive yearly.;;;"The higher required income level for spouses of students compared to students is primarily due to eligibility criteria for financial aid and immigration status. Financial aid packages are often based on the family's total income, not just the student's. Therefore, if a spouse has an income, it may disqualify the student from receiving need-based financial aid.

Additionally, in many countries, international students require a sponsor to meet certain income thresholds to secure a study visa for their spouses. This is to ensure that the spouse will not be a burden on public funds during their stay. These income requirements are often higher than those for students because they must support themselves and their family members."

The information gathered through tracing is important for decision-making and can later help reunite the family.

Tracing is always carried out taking into account the best interest of the child. It is usually in the best interest of the child to know where his or her parents or guardians are. According to the Aliens Act, measures must be taken to trace the parents or some other persons responsible for the actual custody of an unaccompanied minor whenever possible.";;;Tracing, in a general sense, refers to the act of following or examining something closely over time or space to understand its nature, origin, or development. In the context of art, it means copying an original work by using a light source and projecting the image onto another surface, then drawing or painting the projected outline. In computer science, tracing can refer to debugging techniques where the program's execution flow is followed step-by-step to identify errors. In mathematics, it can mean finding the solution of a function by successive approximations. In forensic science, it refers to the process of identifying and analyzing physical evidence left at a crime scene.
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/faq-refugees-and-asylum-seekers;What is meant by age determination and why is this necessary for an asylum seeker?;"Age assessment is an important part of establishing an asylum seeker’s identity. Some statutory rights and obligations of asylum seekers depend on their age. For example, a child under the age of 18 applying for international protection who does not have a guardian is safeguarded through special arrangements during the asylum process and at the reception centre for asylum seekers.

More information: Age assessment or establishment of age of a person younger than 18";18 / eighteen;;"Age determination refers to the process of identifying a person's exact age, often used when the age isn't clearly evident or documented. For an asylum seeker, accurate age verification is crucial for several reasons:

1. Protection: Minors have specific rights and protections under international law, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Accurate age determination ensures they receive appropriate care and protection.

2. Legal Status: Age can impact an individual's legal status in a new country. For example, some countries offer special protections or services to minors that may not be available to adults.

3. Case Assessment: Knowing the age of an asylum seeker can help assess their vulnerability and the nature of their claim. For instance, unaccompanied minors may have unique reasons for seeking asylum, such as family persecution or forced recruitment into armed groups.

4. Family Reunification: Age determination can facilitate family reunification if it's discovered that a minor has relatives in the host country.

5. Integration Services: Accurate age verification helps ensure that integration services are tailored to the individual's needs, taking into account their developmental stage and educational background."

23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children;Why are children interviewed during the asylum process?;"Children have the right to be heard in decisions that affect them. It is in the best interests of a child that his or her opinion is taken into account when such decisions are made.

Another reason for interviewing children who apply for asylum together with their family is that the children may also have their own grounds for asylum.

Under the Aliens Act, the Finnish Immigration Service has an obligation to hear all children over the age of 12 before making a decision that affects them. Even a younger child may be heard if the child is sufficiently mature to have his or her views taken into account. In addition, the agency has a principle of hearing all unaccompanied minor asylum seekers regardless of age.";12 / twelve;;Children may be interviewed during the asylum process to gather information about their experiences, perceptions, and feelings related to the events that led them to seek asylum. These interviews aim to understand the child's individual circumstances, assess their best interests, and ensure their protection under international and domestic laws. The interviews are typically conducted by trained professionals who are sensitive to the needs of children and strive to minimize trauma or distress during the process. It is important to note that these interviews do not determine the outcome of an asylum claim but rather provide additional information to support a comprehensive evaluation of the case.
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children;What is the interview like?;"Interviews with children consist of free narrative, meaning that the child can give their own account. In asylum matters, interview is the most important method to find out what a person has to say about their situation.

Children are interviewed in the presence of their parents, and the parents can participate in the discussion. In addition to the child and his or her parents, there is also an interpreter and a Finnish Immigration Service employee present at the interview. The Finnish Immigration Service uses trained employees who are specialised in interviewing children.

Usually, the interview takes between one and two hours. To make the child feel safe, part of the interview time is used to get to know each other.";;;"An interview is a conversation between you (the candidate) and an employer or recruiter, typically conducted to evaluate your qualifications for a job opening. Here's a general breakdown of what you can expect:

1. **Introduction**: This is where the interviewer introduces themselves and the position, and you have a chance to do the same.

2. **Questions**: The interviewer will ask questions designed to assess your skills, experience, and fit for the job. These may include behavioral questions (about past experiences), technical questions (related to the job requirements), and hypothetical questions (about how you would handle certain situations).

3. **Answering Questions**: Your responses should be clear, concise, and relevant. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers when answering behavioral questions.

4. **Asking Questions**: You'll also have an opportunity to ask questions. This is a chance to show your interest in the role and company, and to clarify any doubts you might have.

5. **Closing the Interview**: The interviewer may provide additional information about the next steps, or ask if you have any final thoughts or questions. It's also a good time to reiterate your interest in the position.

6. **Follow-up**: After the interview, send a thank-you note expressing your appreciation for the opportunity and reiterating your interest in the role. This can help leave a positive impression."
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children;What is meant by a child’s ‘best interests’ in the asylum process?;"The ‘best interests’ of a child is a principle of law that must always be followed when the Finnish Immigration Service makes decisions affecting children.

The best interests of a child are assessed individually on a case-by-case basis. When a decision is made, the overall situation of the child is taken into account. This includes the child’s personal background, situation and needs.

When a best interests assessment is made, several viewpoints are taken into account. The primary criterion is security. A child’s grounds for international protection may be stronger than an adult’s. Children may also have their own grounds for asylum independently of their parents. There are also forms of persecution that only affect children. All this, together with the security situation in the child’s home region, is taken into account in asylum decisions.

When a child’s best interests are assessed, we take into account the child’s family ties and other close relationships as well as the child’s religious, linguistic and cultural background. Also any individual needs concerning, for instance, the child’s development or health are taken into account.";;;In the context of an asylum process, a child's 'best interests' refers to decisions made with the primary consideration being what is beneficial and supportive for the overall well-being, safety, and development of the child. This includes physical, emotional, and psychological needs, as well as education, cultural background, and family ties. The principle aims to minimize harm or trauma, ensure stability, and provide opportunities for growth and integration into society. It's important to note that every child's best interests may vary based on their unique circumstances.
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children;What does the law say about interviewing children?;"In Finland, provisions on interviewing minors are laid down in the Aliens Act (see section 6 of the Aliens Act).

The Finnish Immigration Service has been conducting separate interviews with all co-applicants who have turned 12, and the agency will keep doing so even in the future. That is a statutory duty. The agency has also interviewed younger co-applicants if it has been deemed necessary.

Interviewing minors is and has been an important way of assessing what would be in a child’s best interests in his or her situation.

Children are always interviewed in accordance with their age and maturity. This is a statutory duty laid down in the Aliens Act.";"section 6; 12 / twelve";;"In many jurisdictions, laws regarding interviewing children are designed to protect their well-being and ensure the integrity of evidence. Generally, interviews with children should be conducted in a sensitive manner, taking into account their age, maturity, and understanding.

The U.S. has no federal law specifically governing child interviews, but state laws vary. Some common principles include:

1. Presence of a trusted adult or guardian during the interview, if appropriate.
2. Use of developmentally appropriate language and techniques to communicate with the child.
3. Avoiding leading questions or suggestions that could influence the child's responses.
4. Ensuring the child understands their rights and the purpose of the interview.
5. Providing a supportive and non-threatening environment for the child.
6. Documenting the interview thoroughly, including any visual aids used, the questions asked, and the child's responses.
7. In some cases, the use of forensic interviewers trained in child interview techniques may be required or recommended.
8. The interview should ideally be recorded, but consent from a parent or guardian is usually necessary before doing so.
9. If the interview is part of an investigation, the child's statements must meet certain legal standards to be admissible as evidence in court.
10. In some jurisdictions, there are specific laws regarding the disclosure of information about a child's mental health or medical records during an interview."
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children;Why do you interview children whose parents have converted to Christianity?;"If a child is a member of a religious community, it can affect the child's risk of facing persecution in his or her home country. A person’s religion may constitute grounds for asylum.

Conversion to Christianity may affect a child's daily life in Finland even when he or she is young. The child may, for instance, have participated in church activities.

Naturally, children may be in risk of facing persecution because of other reasons as well. Sometimes, however, these events may have affected the parents in their home country or a long time ago. In such cases, it may not be necessary to interview the children.";religion;;"Interviewing children of converts to Christianity serves several purposes:

1. Understanding the Impact: It helps in understanding how the conversion has impacted the child's life, beliefs, and values. This can provide insights into the effectiveness of religious conversion on the family dynamics and individual psyche.

2. Generational Perspective: Children often represent the next generation. Their experiences and perspectives can offer a unique generational viewpoint on the faith, its acceptance, and practice within the family.

3. Cultural Sensitivity: Children are often more attuned to cultural nuances than adults. They can provide valuable insights into how the new faith is being integrated into their cultural background, thereby offering a richer understanding of interfaith dynamics.

4. Future Prospective: By interviewing children, we can predict potential trends in religious practices and beliefs within the family and community over time. This can help in strategic planning for religious organizations and community development.

5. Empathy and Support: These interviews can also serve as a platform for empathy and support. They can highlight challenges faced by these children, which can guide us towards providing appropriate resources and support systems.

6. Theological Reflection: Children's perspectives can stimulate theological reflection. Their innocent, unfiltered views can challenge adult assumptions about faith and offer fresh insights into religious concepts.

7. Pedagogical Implications: These interviews can provide valuable data for educators and researchers in the field of religion and education. They can help in developing age-appropriate religious education materials and strategies.

8. Psychological Insights: The interviews can also offer psychological insights into the process of religious conversion, particularly its impact on family dynamics and individual identity formation."
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children;What is a child able to tell about his or her situation?;"Interviewing a child is necessary if the matter in question affects the child and if the child can be assumed to have information about the matter.

In the hearing, the child can be asked for instance about what it means to him or her to be a member of a Christian congregation and what the child’s own opinion about this is.

The purpose of asking such questions is to gather additional information about how the child is in risk of persecution. However, the aim is not to use the child's statement against the family. A child’s statement alone cannot determine whether the family is granted asylum or not.

Children are always interviewed in accordance with their age and maturity.";;;A child, depending on their age and development, can express various aspects of their situation. They might share information about their family, friends, school, hobbies, feelings, and experiences. For instance, a preschooler may talk about who they play with at school or what toys they like to play with at home. An older child could describe their daily routine, academic progress, or any challenges they are facing in school or at home. They might also express emotions such as happiness, sadness, fear, or frustration related to their situation. However, it's important to remember that children may not always be able to articulate complex situations or feelings clearly due to their developmental stage. It's crucial to listen carefully and provide support when needed.
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/interviewing-children;What if children say something that contradicts their parents’ statement?;"A child’s statement cannot be the only factor that determines the outcome of a family’s asylum application. If something exceptional comes up, the agency may later ask the parents about it separately.

The purpose of interviewing children is not to use their statements against the family. On the contrary, the aim of the hearing is to see whether the children have anything to add to their parents’ statements.

Children can even have their own grounds for international protection that have not come up before.";;;"In such a situation, it's essential to approach the matter with patience and understanding. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Acknowledge their perspective: Start by acknowledging what your child has said. This shows them that you value their thoughts and feelings. For example, ""I understand that you believe something different about this.""

2. Clarify the discrepancy: Clearly explain the difference between their viewpoint and the one expressed by the parent(s). Use simple, age-appropriate language to ensure they understand.

3. Discuss the reasons behind each stance: Encourage a conversation where both sides can share their reasons for holding their beliefs. This helps children learn critical thinking skills and fosters an environment of open dialogue.

4. Emphasize respect: Remind your child that it's important to respect others, even when they have different opinions. Explain that everyone has the right to their own beliefs as long as they are not causing harm to others.

5. Encourage further discussion: If possible, suggest finding a time to discuss the topic again in the future. This gives both parties an opportunity to gather more information and think about their views more deeply.

6. Model constructive communication: Show your child how to communicate effectively by demonstrating active listening, empathy, and respect when discussing differing viewpoints with others.

7. Reinforce family values: If the disagreement stems from a difference in values, take this opportunity to reinforce the core values that your family holds dear. Explain why these values are important and how they guide decision-making within the family.

8. Encourage independence: Allow your child to make their own decisions when appropriate, while also setting boundaries to ensure their safety and wellbeing. This helps them develop a strong sense of self and fosters resilience.

9. Seek outside perspectives: If needed, consult with other trusted adults or resources to gain additional insights on the topic at hand. This can help provide a more balanced understanding of the issue.

10. Maintain open communication: Encourage ongoing conversations about various topics to build a strong, trusting relationship with your child. This will make it easier for them to come to you with questions or concerns in the future."

23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation;What is an automated decision?;"An automated decision means that our system automatically makes a positive decision on your application if your application meets certain requirements. Our system makes an automated decision only where this is possible under law. Automation is based on the rules formulated by the Finnish Immigration Service. These rules are based on law. The system uses these rules to check whether your application meets the requirements laid down in law. 

See all the requirements for an automated decision on the page Implementation decisions. ";automated decision;;An Automated Decision refers to a process where an outcome or result is determined by a system or software, without human intervention in the critical decision-making steps. This system uses predefined algorithms and data inputs to make decisions based on specific rules or patterns. Examples include credit scoring systems that automatically approve or reject loan applications, fraud detection systems that identify suspicious transactions, and recommendation engines that suggest products or content based on user behavior. Automated Decisions are designed to increase efficiency, reduce human error, and provide consistent outcomes, but they also raise important issues around fairness, transparency, and accountability.
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation;How does automation work?;"We take advantage of automation in decision-making and in the processing of applications. For example, applications are automatically directed to different processing paths, which makes the processing more efficient and improves customer service. In addition to automation, the processing of applications and decision-making involve steps taken by authorities.

Automation is based on the rules formulated by the Finnish Immigration Service. These rules are based on law. The system uses these rules to check whether your application meets the requirements laid down in law. Automated decision-making does not use artificial intelligence.";;;"Automation, in its simplest form, is the use of technology to perform tasks without human intervention. It involves creating systems that can execute repetitive or predictable tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans.

There are three main types of automation: software automation (using scripts or programs to automate tasks on a computer), hardware automation (using machines or robots to perform physical tasks), and business process automation (optimizing and automating workflows within an organization).

The process typically begins with identifying tasks that are repetitive, time-consuming, or prone to errors. These tasks are then broken down into smaller, manageable steps. Next, a system is designed to perform these steps automatically. This could involve writing code for software automation, programming a robot for hardware automation, or creating workflow diagrams for business process automation.

Once the system is in place, it can be tested and refined to ensure it works as intended. After testing, the automated system can be implemented, freeing up human resources to focus on more complex tasks that require creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence.

Automation has numerous benefits, including increased efficiency, reduced errors, and cost savings. However, it also raises concerns about job displacement and the need for workers to acquire new skills to remain competitive in an automated workforce. It's important to strike a balance between automation and human input to maximize productivity while ensuring that humans are still valued for their unique abilities."
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation;You have mentioned earlier that you are using automation. How does the now implemented automated processing differ from the automation used earlier?;"So-called assistive automation has been in use at the Finnish Immigration Service for several years. Assistive automation means that a set of automated rules has been established to help officials verify that an application meets the necessary requirements applicable to the permit in question. A requirement may be automatically marked as met if there is no need for our specialist to assess it. If discretion must be exercised, the requirement is directed to our specialist for examination. Once all the requirements for the application have been met, a draft decision is automatically generated. The draft decision is then validated by our specialist. 

Even though this type of assistive automation has been in use for several years, introducing fully automated decisions has not previously been possible due to a lack of general legislation on the matter. Now that the current legislation allows automated decisions, the Finnish Immigration Service will gradually start identifying standard cases in different permit processes in which automated decisions could be issued. Standard cases are applications that in the authority’s estimation must always be decided on in the same way.";;;"In the evolution of my development, the current implementation of automated processing represents a significant leap forward compared to the initial stages. Earlier automation was primarily focused on simple tasks such as text generation or answering specific questions based on predefined patterns.

The new automation system is more sophisticated and versatile. It employs advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and context-aware understanding to generate responses that are not only accurate but also contextually relevant and engaging. This allows me to handle a wider range of topics, understand complex queries, and even exhibit some degree of creativity in my responses.

Moreover, the new system is equipped with continuous learning capabilities. It learns from each interaction, adapting and improving its responses over time. This ensures that I can provide more accurate and helpful answers as I engage with more users.

In essence, the current automation system is not just a tool for answering questions; it's a dynamic, adaptive, and intelligent conversational partner that can grow and learn alongside my users. This transformation from a simple text-generating machine to an interactive, learning entity has significantly enhanced the user experience and broadened the scope of what I can do."

This could include loan applications, credit scores, employment screening, marketing segmentation, fraud detection, and more. However, it's important to note that the use of automated decisions should comply with relevant laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act in the United States, which aim to prevent discrimination and ensure fairness in decision-making processes.
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation;Can a member of my family receive an automated decision?;"Under law, family members cannot receive an automated decision. Therefore, automated decisions are not given to the applicants who apply for a permit at the same time as their family members.
However, we take account of the family members who are applying for a permit at the same time as the main applicant and try to issue decisions for them at the same time.";;;Yes, a member of your family can potentially receive an automated decision in certain situations, such as when applying for credit, employment, or services online. However, it's important to note that these decisions are typically based on predefined algorithms and data provided by the individual. In many jurisdictions, there are laws in place to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability in automated decision-making processes. If you have concerns about this issue, I recommend researching the specific regulations in your region or consulting with a legal expert.
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation;Why can’t all students get automated decisions?;"We introduce automated decisions in stages. We first start using automated decision-making in the case of degree students at universities and exchange students in all educational institutions, because their applications rarely require individual assessment.
We aim to expand the use of automated decision-making to other standard cases among students’ applications.

University students account for approximately 25 % of all students annually coming to Finland. When some of the students receive an automated decision, our specialists can focus their time on the processing of other applications. This way, automated decisions will shorten the processing times of applications from other students as well.";;;Automated decision-making systems, while efficient and consistent, may not cater to the unique needs, circumstances, and complexities of each student effectively. These systems lack the ability to understand context, empathy, and nuance that human educators bring to their interactions with students. Additionally, these systems might inadvertently perpetuate biases if not properly designed and tested. Lastly, they may not account for the importance of individualized learning paths, which can lead to missed opportunities for growth and development in areas where a student excels or needs extra support. Therefore, while automation has its benefits, it should complement, not replace, human educators in creating well-rounded, successful learners.
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation;You have listed the requirements for an automated decision for citizenship applicants on your website. Will all applicants who meet those requirements get an automated decision?;We have estimated that most of the applicants whose decision is positive will still receive a decision confirmed by an official. An application can be decided on automatically only if the application does not require case-by-case discretion, such as granting an exception to a requirement. A requirement is not met automatically if, for instance, we do not receive all the information from another authority’s register that would be necessary for confirming that the requirements are met. In such a case, an official must examine the matter and assess whether or not the requirement is met. This means that an automated decision is not possible. ;;;While our system aims to provide automated decisions for eligible citizenship applicants, it's important to note that not every application can be processed automatically due to the complexity and variability of individual cases. Some applications may require manual review based on specific circumstances or additional information. Therefore, while meeting the listed requirements increases the likelihood of an automated decision, it does not guarantee one in all cases. Applicants will be informed if their case requires further review.
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation;I have submitted a citizenship application before 2 May 2024 but have not yet received a decision. If I want to get a decision as soon as possible, should I submit a new application in order to get an automated decision?;Despite us having implemented automated decision-making, all citizenship applications will continue to have an official who is responsible for the processing of the application. The automation only concerns the way a decision is created and does not have a direct impact on how quickly an application moves from the queue to being processed. For this reason, it is likely that you would not receive a decision any sooner even if you submitted a new application.;;;While submitting a new application might expedite the process due to the automated system, it's not recommended. Doing so could potentially complicate matters and delay your original application. Instead, contact the relevant immigration authority for updates on your current application status. They may provide additional information or clarify any potential delays.
23.10.2024;https://migri.fi/en/faq-automation;Do you make automated decisions on the other types of citizenship applications, that is, citizenship declarations and applications for release from Finnish citizenship?;At this point, the automated decision-making only concerns citizenship applications, not declarations or other types of citizenship-related applications. However, the scope of the automated decision-making may later be expanded to cover other application types, too. If that happens, we will issue a separate announcement about it.;;;No, automated decisions are not made for citizenship declarations or applications for release from Finnish citizenship. These processes require a case-by-case review by the authorities due to their complex nature and potential impact on an individual's rights and status.

Tell the embassy that you have applied for temporary protection and that you need an identity document for the application. Please note that the passports of Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic are not approved travel documents in Finland because Finland has not recognised the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Under the Aliens Act, there are shorter time limits for processing an application in an accelerated procedure. If the preliminary information on an application indicates that the application meets the criteria for an accelerated procedure, the applicant will be interviewed sooner than usually.

If the preliminary information about an application contains indications of the applicant having grounds for international protection, the application will be processed in the same manner as all other asylum applications. Applicants who enter Finland through the eastern border will be interviewed by us in the same way as other applicants. The grounds for their asylum applications will be examined in the interview.";;I have a question about the situation at Finland’s eastern border;"The rapid processing of applications at Finland's eastern border is primarily due to the EU's Eastern Partnership policy, which aims to strengthen and deepen relations between the European Union (EU) and its six Eastern partner countries, including Ukraine. This policy includes a visa facilitation agreement with Ukraine, which was signed in 2017 and entered into force in 2018.

Under this agreement, certain categories of Ukrainian citizens are eligible for simplified visa procedures, such as reduced processing times and fees. Additionally, Finland has implemented specific measures to expedite the processing of applications from Ukraine due to the large number of applicants and the geographical proximity of the two countries. These measures include increasing staff at border crossings, implementing electronic registration systems, and providing additional resources for case management.

It is important to note that while the visa application process may be quicker for certain categories of Ukrainian citizens, all applications are still subject to thorough review and security checks to ensure that only genuine applicants who meet the requirements of the Schengen Visa Code are granted visas."

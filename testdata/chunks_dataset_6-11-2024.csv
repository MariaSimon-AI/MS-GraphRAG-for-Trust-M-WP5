Your Finnish family member must have lived in an EU Member State other than Finland, or in a country comparable to EU Member States, for at least 3 months.
The relationship that made you each other’s family members must have begun or strengthened while you were residing in an EU Member State other than Finland. If you and your family member do not move from the other Member State to Finland simultaneously, your Finnish family member needs to have moved to Finland first, before you. You and your Finnish family member need to have moved to Finland directly from the other Member State. If you have lived in a third country between your residence in a Member State and your move to Finland, apply for a residence permit as a spouse of a Finnish citizen. If your Finnish family member holds the citizenship of another EU Member State and has only lived in the Member States where he or she holds citizenship, your family member has not exercised his or her right of free movement. In such a case, you need to apply for a residence permit as a spouse of a Finnish citizen. When you apply for EU registration as a family member of a Finnish citizen, you are not required to present documentation of sufficient financial resources.
If none of these grounds are applicable to you, you may still stay in Finland as long as you have sufficient financial resources to support yourself and your family members. It is possible that more than one of these grounds are applicable to you during your stay in Finland. Even if your grounds for residence change, you do not need to renew your EU registration.
4. You have sufficient financial resources for living in Finland for yourself and for your family members.
If you apply for EU registration on the basis of sufficient financial resources, you are not required to have a specific amount of money. However, you must have enough funds to support yourself and your family members. Social assistance, for example, must not be your principal means of support. When assessing whether or not your financial resources are sufficient, the Finnish Immigration Service will consider your personal circumstances. Different grounds for residence have different requirements when it comes to financial resources.
If you are an employee or a self-employed person, no specific amount of money is required but you need to present documentation of your employment or self-employment.

The application will be put in the processing queue of the Finnish Immigration Service. Processing Time Checker will tell you the expected processing time of your application. In addition, you will usually receive automated messages at the different processing stages of your application. Do not submit an incomplete application. If an obligatory attachment is missing, it will slow down the processing and you may receive a negative decision. If we notice that any obligatory attachments are missing or if we need additional information from you while we are processing your application, we will contact you.
Supplementing or cancelling your application
If you have submitted your application through the e-service, you may also supplement it there. If you have submitted a paper application, you may supplement it by post. You may cancel your application at any time during its processing. Read more on the page Cancelling an application. The processing fee will not be returned to you even if you cancel your application.
Decision and notification of the decision
If you have applied for citizenship through the e-service Enter Finland, you will get an e-mail or a text message when a decision has been made. You will also see it in your user account in the online service. If you have submitted a paper application, you will be notified of the decision by post. Some decisions will be sent by post with an advice of delivery. If you receive a positive decision, the information about your Finnish citizenship will be automatically entered into the Population Information System. A Finnish citizen cannot have a residence permit in Finland. If you are granted Finnish citizenship, your residence permit will be cancelled. Submit your residence permit card, the registration certificate of your right of residence, or your residence permit sticker to the Finnish Immigration Service for cancelling. Finnish passports are granted by the police (poliisi. fi). The processing fee will not be returned to you even if you receive a negative decision.
Appealing a decision
If you receive a negative decision, the Finnish law gives you the right to appeal against the decision to an Administrative Court. Instructions on how to appeal will be attached to the decision. The majority of decisions made by the Administrative Courts are subject to a fee. Contact an Administrative Court to find out more about court fees. In citizenship-related matters, send your appeal directly to an Administrative Court.",Finnish citizenship

However, they are not official identity documents. They cannot be used as identity documents even if your document does not include the remark ‘Identity not verified’. If you need an official identity document, you can apply for an identity card from the police (poliisi. fi). You can only use one travel document You may only use one travel document: either the passport of your country of nationality or a travel document issued by the Finnish Immigration Service (a refugee travel document or an alien’s passport). If you have refugee status or subsidiary protection status in Finland, you need to choose which travel document you want to use:If you have refugee status in Finland, you need to choose whether you will use the valid passport of your country of nationality or a refugee travel document. If you have subsidiary protection status in Finland, you need to choose whether you will use the passport of your country of nationality or an alien's passport. If you decide to use a refugee travel document or an alien’s passport, you need to hand over the passport of your country of nationality to the Finnish Immigration Service. We will keep the passport in our archive. If you obtain a new passport that is issued by your country of nationality, visit a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service to present your new passport there. Your valid refugee travel document or alien’s passport will then be withdrawn. Please note:You may lose your refugee status or subsidiary protection status if the authorities of your country of nationality extend the validity period of your passport or if you obtain a new passport that is issued by your country of nationality. Travelling Check with the authorities of your country of destination to find out if an alien’s passport or a refugee travel document allows you to travel to that country. Finnish authorities, such as the Finnish Immigration Service, do not decide to which countries you may or may not travel with an alien’s passport or a refugee travel document. When you depart from or return to Finland, you must have a valid travel document and a valid residence permit card. Checking your residence permit If your residence permit has been issued on 1 January 2012 or later, you have received a separate residence permit card. If your residence permit has been issued on 31 December 2011 or before that, your travel document contains a residence permit sticker. Biometric travel documents If your alien's passport or refugee travel document has been issued on 21 August 2016 or later, it contains a microchip. Travel documents that contain a microchip are called biometric travel documents. The chip stores the information contained in the travel document: a facial photo, personal data, information on the passport, and fingerprints of persons over 12 years of age. A biometric alien’s passport or refugee travel document is valid for five years at maximum. The validity period of the passport cannot be extended.

1. The calculation of the processing time begins when you have visited the Finnish Immigration Service or a Finnish mission to prove your identity
Applications submitted using the Enter Finland online service The expected processing time is calculated starting from the date on which you visit a Finnish embassy or consulate abroad or a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service in Finland to prove your identity. During this visit, you prove your identity, provide your fingerprints, and, if necessary, present the original copies of the attachments required for your application. If it is not necessary to visit a service point in your case, the processing time is calculated starting from when you submit your application in Enter Finland. For more information about the cases in which visiting a service point is not necessary, see th page Identification.
Applications submitted on paper The expected processing time is calculated starting from the date on which you deliver the completed application form and the required attachments to a Finnish embassy or consulate abroad or a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service in Finland. If your employer needs to add your terms of employment to the application The calculation of the processing time begins when your employer has supplemented your application by filling in your terms of employment. This applies even if you have already proven your identity at an earlier time.
If you apply for asylum The processing time is calculated from when you notify the police or the border control authorities in Finland that you want to apply for asylum. If it has been necessary to determine the state responsible for processing your asylum application in Finland, the processing time is calculated from when the substantive examination of your asylum application has begun in Finland. If you have been transferred to Finland in the Dublin procedure, the processing time for your asylum application is calculated from when you have arrived in Finland and your asylum application has been registered in Finland. More information about substantive examinations and the Dublin procedure.
2. The time we spend waiting for further information or a payment from you does not count as processing time
If we need to ask you for further information or invite you to an interview, the calculation of the processing time of your application is put on hold. Sometimes it takes a long time before an interview takes place. The counting of the processing time continues after we have received the necessary information from you. The counting of the processing time is also put on hold if you have not paid the processing fee. The counting continues when you have paid the fee.
3. The processing time ends when we make a decision on your application
The expected processing time ends when we make a decision on your application. The time we need to serve you the decision and deliver a residence permit card to you are not included in the expected processing time.

When I tried to book an appointment, I was told that there are no available times for proving my identity within the three-month time limit. What should I do? Exceeding the time limit for the reason that the authorities have no available appointments will not affect the processing of your application. If the authorities have given you an appointment for proving your identity, you do not need to ask for extra time. Inform us of the appointment you have been given within 3 months from submitting the application on the page ‘Send additional information’ in the online service Enter Finland. How do I book an appointment to apply for an extended permit? Book an appointment according to the reason you are applying for a residence permit. This can be work, studies or family ties. If you applying for a residence permit for another reason, choose ‘Other grounds’. The appointment system of the Finnish Immigration Service does not separate between an application for a first permit and an application for an extended permit. If you are applying for an extended permit, don’t book an appointment to renew your residence permit card. Only book an appointment to renew your residence permit card, if your right of residence is valid but you need to renew your residence permit card, for example, because you have lost a card that you have already been issued with. When will new times become available in the appointment system? New appointments become available all the time. There are no available appointments in your appointment system. What should I do? Check the appointment system
again later for available appointment times. New appointment times become available every week. If your permit does not expire during the next two months, please be patient and wait for new appointments to become available.

https://www.migri.fi/en/forecasts,"Forecasts about the number of applications On this page you will find the following forecasts:applications for temporary protectionfirst asylum applicationsfirst residence permit applications for studiesfirst residence permit applications on the basis of employment The Finnish Immigration Service’s foresight network consists of experts who meet three times a year to make quantitative and qualitative forecasts about migration to Finland and about asylum seekers arriving in Finland. The Finnish Immigration Service makes the projections in cooperation with different interest groups, and is responsible for coordinating the work of the foresight network. The network’s operations are directed by an inter-administrative steering group consisting of different authorities. The Finnish Immigration Service’s foresight network updated its estimates for 2024 and 2025 in February 2024. The forecasts are updated three times a year and published on the website of the Finnish Immigration Service. This page was last updated on 20 March 2024. Need for temporary protection will continue in the coming years The volume of applications for temporary protection has been decreasing since the autumn of 2023. The weekly number of applications has been well below 200 in early 2024. Despite the decrease, applications are still being submitted regularly. According to the updated forecast of the foresight network, 8,000–12,000 applicants for temporary protection will arrive in Finland in 2024. According to the forecast, the number of applications submitted in 2025 will be 5,000–10,000. The number of applicants arriving from Ukraine depends on factors such as:the duration and extent of the warthe development of the humanitarian situation in Ukrainethe strain on the reception capacity especially in Ukraine’s neighbouring countries and in the Baltic countries National changes in social security or temporary protection conditions in the main host countries for Ukrainians the number of Ukrainians who move between EU countries. There are considerable uncertainties about the estimated number of applications in 2024–2025, as it is difficult to predict how the war in Ukraine and the resulting refugee situation develop. Temporary protection has been extended by decision of the Council of the European Union until March 2025. Number of asylum applications is expected to increase moderately The future projections of the Finnish Immigration Service do not take a position on the change in the number of asylum seekers as a result of hybrid operations or the instrumentalisation of migrants. The projections for this specific aspect are therefore not included in the current estimates of the number of applications. The preparation for instrumentalisation operations is part of the preparedness and contingency activities of the administrative department of the Ministry of the Interior. The number of asylum applications in the European Union has remained at a high level since 2022. The high number of applications is partly due to protracted conflicts in the main countries of origin and the strain on the internal refugee situation in transit countries. However, the increase in the number of asylum applications in Europe has not had a major impact on application volumes in Finland. Number of first asylum applications has returned to pre-pandemic levels In 2023, a total of 4,559 first asylum applications were submitted in Finland. Of the total number of asylum seekers, approximately 1,300 arrived in Finland via the eastern border between July and December. As for January–February 2024, a total of 514 first asylum applications were submitted in Finland. Number of asylum applications submitted by Russian nationals has remained low There was a marked increase in the number of asylum applications submitted by Russian citizens after Russia declared a military mobilisation in the autumn of 2022. However, following the imposition of entry and visa restrictions in late September, asylum application volumes declined rapidly and have remained low. The opportunities for Russian citizens to apply for asylum remain limited due to existing entry restrictions at the Finnish-Russian border, limited visa issuance, and the inspection activities of the Russian border authorities. The average annual number of asylum applications is estimated at 4,000The foresight network estimates that the number of first asylum applications will reach 3,500-4,500 per year in 2024-2025. The reasons behind the expected increase include prolonged conflicts in countries of origin most relevant to Finland and the strained refugee situation within transit countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Libya. However, the control of the internal and external borders of Europe and the geographical distance between Finland and the key entry routes constrain the increase. However, rapid and unexpected changes in the number of applications for international protection are possible. Moreover, the estimate does not take into account asylum applications submitted in Finland as a result of instrumentalisation operations. The number of student applications to Finland is expected to increase in the coming years In 2023, a record number of first-time applications for residence permits on the basis of studies were submitted, totalling 12,867 applications. The forecast network estimates that the number of student applicants will continue to be high. A total of 884 applications were submitted in January–February 2024, corresponding to the number of applications submitted in early 2023. The number of applications is expected to reach 14,000 in 2024 and 15,000 in 2025. The significant increase in applications for student residence permits can be explained by factors such as changes in the legislation on residence permits for students and researchers, as well as an increase in international study programmes and student numbers at higher education institutions. In addition, information about Finland is spread quickly on social media by students already living in the country, making Finland a more attractive place to study. The change in the number of first-time applications for residence permits by students is influenced by the following factors:the available intake for international degree programmeseducation exports and the number of students attending various courses that do not lead to a qualification Finland’s attractiveness as a place to live and study. Economic downturn is reflected in the number of work-based residence permit applications The total number of first-time applications for residence permits based on employment in 2023 fell by about 19% from the record high of the previous year. A total of 16,999 applications were submitted. Although the number of applications was significantly lower than in 2022, it was still higher than in 2018-2021. The number of first work-based residence permit applications submitted in January–February 2024 was 2,733. It is lower in comparison to the same time period in 2023. The number of applications is estimated to reach 19,000 in 2024 and 20,500 in 2025. The change in the number of applications for residence permits depends mainly on economic developments. Despite cyclical fluctuations, the ageing population and skills shortages are creating a need for foreign workers. Therefore, the number of employment-based residence permit applications is expected to increase moderately in the coming years. The number of first work-based residence permit applications depends on factors including the weaker economic situation and its durationthe development of international recruitment networks national meaures, and the decline of the working-age population, and labour market mismatches.",Forecasts

Those refugees whom UNHCR has defined as belonging to the emergency category (emergency and urgent cases) are in need of urgent resettlement due to a special need for protection or other reasons such as exceptionally strong humanitarian reasons or an acute need for medical care/treatment. Persons submitted to Finland, must have been granted a refugee status by UNHCR. Decisions are made based on the background documents. This is exceptional as all the other quota refugees are selected to Finland based on an individual interview. We do not have any geographical limitations concerning the country of origin or the first country of asylum of the emergence referrals to Finland.

https://www.migri.fi/en/quota-refugees,"Quota refugees A quota refugee is a personwho has had to leave his or her home country or country of permanent residence; andwho cannot stay in the country to which he or she has fled; andwhom the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR has determined to be a refugee. In Finland, when the Parliament approves the Budget for each year, it also decides how many quota refugees Finland commits to receiving. During the years 2001–2019, the refugee quota was 750 persons per year. The refugee quota was 850 persons in 2020, 1,050 persons in 2021, 1,500 persons in 2022, and 1,050 persons in 2023. Finland’s refugee quota for 2024 is 500 persons. Persons who have been determined as refugees by UNHCR and whom UNHCR has suggested for resettlement in Finland can be admitted to Finland as quota refugees. UNHCR determines which refugees need help the most and proposes these persons to be resettled in Finland as part of the refugee quota. Finland does not ask UNHCR to propose predefined persons, such as your parents or siblings, as quota refugees. UNHCR decides which persons need help the most and whom it will suggest to be resettled in Finland. As for relatives residing abroad, your relatives must visit a UNHCR office and apply for international protection. In the UNHCR interviews, your relatives should mention that they have relatives in Finland and tell about their wish to move to Finland. Emergency or urgent cases In recent years, a part of the refugee quota has been reserved for refugees who the UNHCR has estimated to be in need of urgent resettlement. Finland selects these emergency cases on the basis of UNHCR documents, without interviews. The number of emergency cases to be admitted will be 50 persons in 2024.",Quota refugees 
https://www.migri.fi/en/quota-refugees,"Arrival in Finland Quota refugees do not live in reception centres. Instead, they move directly to Finnish municipalities. A quota refugee may only arrive in Finland after a municipality has agreed to take him or her and offer him or her an apartment. The Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment (ELY Centres) are in charge of directing quota refugees to the municipalities. Each ELY Centre negotiates with the municipalities in its area and agrees on the number of refugees to be resettled into each municipality. The state pays compensation to the municipalities for receiving quota refugees and organising integration services. If you have been admitted to Finland under the refugee quota (resettlement program), you can find more information on the website: www. movingtofinland. fi. Videos for the refugees moving to Finland in the resettlement program The Finnish Immigration Service has published
videos about Finland on the agency’s You Tube channel.

https://www.migri.fi/en/disclosure-of-data-for-scientific-research-purposes,"Disclosure of data for scientific research purposes It is possible to request data from the data systems and registers of the Finnish Immigration Service for the purpose of conducting scientific research. Researchers can submit a document and information request or an application for a research permit to the Finnish Immigration Service.
In general, information and documents concerning customers of the Finnish Immigration Service are kept secret under section 24(1)(24) of the Act on the Openness of Government Activities, unless it is obvious that disclosure of information from them will not compromise the safety of the person concerned or his or her friends or family. On a case-to-case basis, the Finnish Immigration Service may grant permission to gain access to a secret document for purposes of scientific research, statistical compilations or the preparation of official plans or studies, if it is obvious that access will not violate the interests protected by the secrecy provision.
If you wish to gain access to confidential information for the purpose of scientific research, you need to apply for a research permit. The application must contain your basic details and specify, in as much detail as possible, which information you need and for what purpose. Your application must contain a research plan in which you describe what data you need and why.
The Finnish Immigration Service will decide whether a research permit can be granted. When evaluating the research permit application, the Finnish Immigration Service will consider the freedom of science, the legal basis for granting a research permit, the legislation governing the disclosure of data, and the appropriateness of granting a research permit.
Research permits are granted for a fixed term, and they may also be cancelled if there are grounds for doing so.
As a rule, the Finnish Immigration Service does not grant access to secret documents for thesis projects conducted for a university degree. Thesis projects are not regarded as scientific research within the meaning of section 28 of the Act on the Openness of Government Activities. If you need data for your thesis, you can submit a document request. Applying for research permit Research permit application If you need confidential information from the registers of the Finnish Immigration Service for the purposes of scientific research, you have two options:•

The research plan must contain at least the following information:a detailed account of the topic of the study;the background for the study;the objective of the study;as detailed account of the research questions and methods as possible;the schedule for the study;a description of the publishing and utilisation of the research results;the data needed for the study and a description of why this data is necessary for the study. If the data to be disclosed for scientific research purposes on a large scale involves processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or special categories of personal data, such as information about a person’s ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs or sexual orientation, a derogation from the rights of data subjects requires, as laid down in section 31 of the Data Protection Act (1050/2018), that a data protection impact assessment referred to in Article 35 of the Data Protection Regulation be carried out or that codes of conduct in accordance with Article 40 of the Data Protection Regulation be complied with.

To be issued with the permit, you must meet the requirements for obtaining the permit. For example, you must hold a passport issued by your country of nationality. When making the decision, we will take into account the protection of family life and the best interest of the child if they are affected by the decision. I’m a citizen of Somalia applying for a residence permit in Finland on the basis of family reunification. I have a passport issued by Somalia. Can I get a residence permit? You cannot prove your identity with a Somali passport, as Finland does not accept Somali passports. See the website of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for more information about Somali passports (um. fi). When making a decision on your application, the protection of family life and the best interest of the child are taken into account. Despite the amendments to the Aliens Act that entered into force on 1 September 2024, the established practice based on the protection of family life will continue, and Somali citizens can be exempted from the travel document requirement in the case of family reunification.

I applied for an extended permit on 2 September 2024. How does the gap between my permits affect the processing of my application? You are required to apply for a new residence permit before your valid residence permit expires. If you do not apply for a new permit in time, you are staying in the country illegally during the gap between your permits, which can lead to a negative decision. When we process your application, the duration of your illegal stay will be of relevance. In such a case, we will assess whether there are acceptable reasons for applying for a permit late. Such reasons include, for example, a severe illness or accident that has prevented you from applying for a residence permit. If you have applied for an extended permit too late, your right to work has ended. Read more about the right to work. The gap between your permits will also be of relevance if you apply for a permanent residence permit or Finnish citizenship. I need to apply for an extended permit. Can I submit my application even though my passport has expired? You can submit an application even though your passport has expired, but we cannot grant you a residence permit before you hold a valid passport issued by your country of nationality.

However, we will not reject your residence permit application because you do not have a passport in the following cases: You are applying for a residence permit for a child born in Finland.
We will issue the child with an alien’s passport so that the child can obtain a national passport. If the child’s country of nationality has an embassy or a consulate in Finland, the child must primarily obtain a passport issued by his or her country of nationality. You need a residence permit on a discretionary basis on humanitarian grounds. You are a victim of human trafficking. You are applying for asylum or temporary protection. You have applied for international protection and are applying for an extended permit or a permanent residence permit on the basis of international protection. You are applying for a residence permit as a family member of a person who has received international protection and are granted international protection.

If you are applying for a first residence permit or an extended permit, you can be exempted from the passport requirement in the following cases:
You are applying for a residence permit for a child born in Finland.
We will issue the child with an alien’s passport so that the child can obtain a passport issued by his or her country of nationality.

Additionally, you still need to meet the requirements for the permit. A permanent residence permit can also be granted when the applicant does not have a passport if there are exceptionally serious grounds for it or if it is in the best interest of the child. I do not have a passport issued by my country of nationality. Can I still apply for a residence permit? You can always submit an application, if you like. The amendments that introduced stricter passport requirements entered into force on 1 September 2024. You are required to hold a valid passport issued by your country of nationality in order to be granted a residence permit. In some cases, it is possible to exempt the applicant from the passport requirement. Processing time How can I expedite the processing of my residence permit application? Fill in all the required information on the application form carefully and append any required appendices. Providing insufficient information slows the processing of your application because additional clarification is required from you. Giving insufficient information may also lead to an unfavourable decision. Telephone enquiries and visits to any of the service points do no expedite the processing of your case. We will contact you if additional information is required. The average processing times can be found on the Processing times page. I have applied for a permanent residence permit but I have heard that it would go faster to get an extended permit. Can I apply for an extended permit (an A permit) even if I already have applied for a permanent permit? The processing times of applications for permanent permits and extended permits are different. You can apply for an extended permit even if you already have applied for a permanent permit. In that case, you do not need to cancel your application for a permanent permit. Cancelling your application for a permanent permit may result in a gap between your residence permits. That is why it is advisable to wait until decisions on both applications are ready. If a permanent residence permit is then granted, you can cancel your application for an extended permit after that. Changing the grounds for application I have applied for a residence permit on the grounds of work and I have not yet received a decision. I just got married. Do I need to fill in a new application? You do not need to fill in a new application, unless you wish to change the grounds for your residence permit application. You must, however, inform the Finnish Immigration Service of your marriage. This is especially important if you are changing your name Send a certified copy of your marriage certificate to the Finnish Immigration Service, either directly or via a Finnish embassy. Certificates issued by authorities of countries other than Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark or Iceland must be legalised. If the certificate is not in Finnish, Swedish, or English, please also send a translation of the certificate in one of these languages, certified by an authorised translator. I have applied for a residence permit on the grounds of work and I just got married. May I change the grounds for my application? No, you may not.

When you apply for a permit on new grounds, the processing time starts to run again from the beginning. The processing time depends on the type of your application. Remember to cancel your previous application if you wish to apply for a permit only on your new grounds. I have applied for a residence permit on the basis of an established intimate relationship. After submitting the application, I have married my partner. Can I change the grounds for my application?

I would like to travel in Finland for a short time after the expiry of my residence permit. Should I apply for a new permit or what should I do? If you are a foreign national free of visa you may stay in Finland and Schengen area for a maximum period of 90 days. Other foreign nationals must leave Finland when the residence permit expires. Residence permits cannot be granted for holiday travel. I have applied for a residence permit but I have not yet received a decision. I will soon be travelling abroad for a holiday.

Your permit has been granted on the basis of family ties, so the grounds for your residence in Finland still exist. Becoming unemployed does not affect your residence permit. I have been laid off temporarily. Will my residence permit be withdrawn? If the lay-off is temporary, we will not start considering whether your permit should be withdrawn. In other words, we will not withdraw your permit if you have been laid off temporarily and the end date of your lay-off is known.

If you are planning to move from Finland, for example, to work or study abroad for at least two years, you should send an application to the Finnish Immigration Service to prevent the cancellation of your residence permit.

The amendments to the Aliens Act are not subject to a transition period, which means that your application will be processed in accordance with the new rules as soon as they enter into force. See the web pages concerning the type of application you submitted for information about how the requirements for granting the permit have changed. If you notice that important information is missing, you can supplement your application with additional information.

If you applied for a residence permit using a paper form, you can send us additional information by email to migri@migri. fi.

If you have applied for a residence permit using the application for an employed person, specialist, the EU Blue Card, athlete, person with a degree or research completed in Finland, or other employment, and meet the requirements for the residence permit based on your application documents, the Finnish Immigration Service will grant you the permit without additional steps.

residence permit for a specialist, but your salary no longer meets the criteria set for specialists, or applied for a residence permit on the basis of other employment as the employee of an association, but do not work in the service of a religious community in a position that involves practising the religion, it is possible that you cannot be granted the residence permit for which you have applied.

You will also receive instructions on how to pay the difference in the processing fees for the permits. If you do not agree to change your application or pay the difference in the processing fees, we may not be able to grant you a residence permit. The legal provision printed on my residence permit card regarding the grounds for my right to work does not match the provision in the new law. Do I need to apply for a new residence permit card? No, you do not. See our work in Finland page for a table of all old legal provisions regarding the right to work. No changes have been made to the actual right to work, and only the legal provisions of the Aliens Act regarding the right to work have changed. You or your employer can use the table to check the new legal provision on the right to work.
You will receive a new card with the new legal provision printed on it when you apply for an extended permit, or a new card after your card expires or goes missing, for example.

In some cases, you need to have the documents attached to your application translated and legalised. Interpretation If you are applying for asylum in Finland and need an interpreter at your asylum interview, the Finnish Immigration Service will provide one for you. You do not need to pay for the interpretation. If you are applying for another type of permit, such as a residence permit or EU registration, you must pay the interpreter’s fee yourself. If you are in Finland, the Finnish Immigration Service makes the necessary arrangements for an interpreter to be present at your interview. If you are abroad, the arrangements are made by the Finnish mission. Your interview invitation contains more detailed instructions. It is possible that you will not be interviewed at all. The decision as to whether you will be invited to take part in an interview is made during the processing of your application. Translations If the documents attached to your application are written in a language other than Finnish, Swedish or English, you must have them translated by an authorised translator (search engine available in Finnish and Swedish) or by a translator who is considered to be an official translator by another EU Member State. You can ask the Finnish mission in your country of residence whether they know of any authorised translators in that country. You may have your documents translated by a translator who is not an authorised translator but in that case you need to have the translation legalised. You must pay for translations yourself. Documents issued by an EU Member State do not need to be translated ifthe document in question concerns birth, marriage, a registered partnership, or death, andyou also submit a multilingual standard form issued by the relevant authority.

There are two ways to legalise documents The appropriate method of legalisation depends on the country that issued the document in question. The document was issued by a country that is party to the Hague Convention Have the document legalised with an apostille certificate. Check a list of countries that are party to the Hague Convention (hcch. net).

Exceptions to translation and legalisation requirements If you are an asylum seeker, you do not need to have your documents translated or legalised. If you are applying for a residence permit on the basis of family ties, you do not need to have your documents legalised if your family member has been granted international protection in Finland, and you are unable to have the documents legalised.

You can check if your employee has the right to reside in Finland by asking him or her to show: a valid residence permit carda certificate of a pending residence permit application. An employee who does not have these documents may still be residing legally in Finland. Your employee may be, for instance, an asylum seeker or a seasonal worker who is working in Finland for up to three months with a visa or visa-free.

This is why you, as the employer, must primarily establish that your employee has the right to work in Finland.
2. How to verify an employee’s right to work
This is how you can verify your employee’s right to work: The employee’s residence permit shows what type of work the employee is allowed to do and how many hours a week he or she is allowed to work.

Once the certification has been granted, a separate assessment will not be required when individual residence permit applications are processed.

The D visa allows the employee's residence permit card to be delivered directly to Finland, and the employee can travel to Finland 1–2 weeks earlier than usual. However, these benefits do not apply if your employee is applying for a residence permit on the basis of intra-corporate transfer, seasonal work, research work or internship.

Hiring an employee who already holds a valid residence permit that has been issued on the basis of work is not counted towards your company’s residence permits in the certification application.

In most cases, you can apply for an extended permit using the same application you used for your previous residence permit. In some cases, you need to submit a different application. Apply for an extended permit on the main grounds of your residence in Finland. For example, if you study or work, or if you are married and work, select the most important reason why you are in Finland, and use it as the grounds for applying for an extended permit.

A decision on removal from the country means either denial of admittance or stay or deportation, depending on your situation. Decision on denial of admittance or stay When the decision on your application for a first residence permit is negative, you will also be given a decision on denial of admittance or stay. If you object to being denied admittance or stay because your human rights or safety would be endangered in your home country or country of permanent residence, you can lodge an application for international protection with the police or the border control authorities. See the page Information for asylum seekers for more information about the asylum procedure. The decision on denial of admittance or stay may set a time limit for you to leave Finland voluntarily. Usually, the time limit for leaving Finland voluntarily is 30 days. The time limit is counted from the day when you have been served with the decision on denial of admittance or stay. In contrast, if you appeal against the decision on your residence permit application to an administrative court and the court prohibits the enforcement of the Finnish Immigration Service’s decision, the time limit will be counted from the administrative court's decision on your residence permit application. If you wish to return to your home country voluntarily, you may be granted assistance for voluntary return. Read more about voluntary return on the page Voluntary return. If you do not leave Finland voluntarily, the police or the Border Guard will remove you from the country. You may also be issued with an entry ban to the Schengen area if, for example:your application was rejected because you have evaded immigration regulations, for example by entering a sham marriageyou are considered to present a danger to public order or security, for example because you have committed crimesyour application for international protection is rejected in an accelerated procedureyou do not leave Finland voluntarily within the time limit given to you. For more information on denial of admittance or stay for asylum seekers, see the page Denial of admittance or stay. An entry ban means that you cannot enter Finland or other Schengen countries while the entry ban is in force. Decision on deportation You will be issued with a decision on deportation if you already have a residence permit in Finland but you are not granted an extended permit or your residence permit is withdrawn. You may also be deported if you have committed crimes in Finland. If you object to being deported because your human rights or safety would be endangered in your home country or country of permanent residence, you can lodge an application for international protection with the police or the border control authorities. See the page Information for asylum seekers for more information about the asylum procedure. Your residence permit expires when you are deported from Finland. In other words, the residence permit that you have had stops being valid when you are deported. If you do not leave Finland, the police or the Border Guard will enforce the deportation. In other words, they will remove you from the country. The decision on deportation may set a time limit for you to leave Finland voluntarily. Usually, the time limit for leaving Finland voluntarily is 30 days. The time limit is counted from the day when the deportation decision becomes final or from when the deportation decision becomes enforceable. This means that even if you have appealed against the decision issued by an administrative court to the Supreme Administrative Court, the decision on deportation will still be enforceable unless the Supreme Administrative Court separately prohibits the enforcement. After the Supreme Administrative Court has issued a final decision in such situations, the decision on deportation becomes final. In such a case, the counting of the time limit for leaving the country voluntarily starts over. If you have applied for an extended permit for seasonal work, the time limit for voluntary return begins when you are served with the decision made by the Finnish Immigration Service. If you wish to return to your home country voluntarily, you can apply for assistance for voluntary return. Read more about voluntary return on the page Voluntary return.

In both cases, the maternity of the non-birth mother must have been officially confirmed.

In this case, becoming a citizen requires that:the paternity is confirmed and the acknowledgement of paternity is also valid in Finland (dvv. fi) ; andthe father has been a Finnish citizen without interruption since the child was born. 4. How the annulment of parenthood affects a child’s citizenship A child may lose his or her Finnish citizenship if:the child has become a Finnish citizen based on the father’s or the non-birth mother’s citizenship; and the parenthood is annulled.

https://www.migri.fi/cancellation-of-a-permit,"Withdrawal of residence permits If you are residing outside Finland permanently, you can ask the Finnish Immigration Service to cancel your residence permit. In some cases, the Finnish Immigration Service may withdraw your residence permit without a separate request from you. Before making a withdrawal decision, we will contact you to ask for your opinion on the possible withdrawal of your permit. In some cases, you can file an application for preventing the Finnish Immigration Service from withdrawing your residence permit. Please note that the instructions on this page only concern fixed-term residence permits, permanent residence permits and long-term resident’s EU residence permits for third-country nationals (P-EU). The instructions on this page do not apply to EU registrations or to those who hold a residence card for an EU citizen's family member. For information about cancellation of EU registrations and residence cards for EU citizens’ family members, see the page Cancellation and expiration of right of residence. You may ask us to cancel your residence permit by submitting a written notification If you need us to cancel your residence permit, you can submit a free-form written notification in Finnish, Swedish or English. The notification must contain the following information:The reason why you no longer need your residence permit. Your first and last name. Your personal identity code or your date of birth. A postal address to which the Finnish Immigration Service can send the withdrawal decision.
If you are moving abroad soon, state your new address and mention when you are moving. Date of signature. Your signature. Send the notification to the Finnish Immigration Service. For contact details, see the page Contact information. Your permit may also be withdrawn without you requesting withdrawal Your residence permit may be withdrawn if you have given false information, if the grounds on which the permit was issued no longer exist, if you hold a residence permit for an employed person and become unemployed, if you hold an EU Blue Card and become unemployed, if an entry ban to the Schengen area has been imposed on you by another Schengen State, or if you have permanently moved out of Finland. 1. If you have deliberately given false information We may cancel your residence permit if: you have knowingly given false information about your identity or about other matters relevant to the decision when you applied for a residence permit; or you have concealed information that might have prevented the issue of the residence permit. 2. The grounds on which your permit was issued no longer exist We may cancel your fixed-term residence permit if the grounds on which the permit was issued no longer exist. Your residence permit may be withdrawn if, for example:You hold a residence permit on the basis of family ties but your family ties have broken. You hold a residence permit that requires sufficient financial resources but you no longer meet the income requirement. Read more about the income requirement. In general, we do not cancel residence permits that are valid for less than 6 months. If your grounds for residing in Finland have changed, read more about applying for a residence permit on new grounds. 3. If you hold a residence permit for an employed person but become unemployed If you have been granted a residence permit on the basis of employment, we may initiate a process for withdrawing your residence permit after you have been unemployed for 3 months. We will not withdraw your permit if your residence permit expires in less than 6 months or if you have been laid off temporarily, and the end date of your lay-off is known. Unemployment will only affect fixed-term permits that have been granted on the basis of employment. If you have a permanent residence permit, for example, the end of your employment will not affect your permit. For more information about residence permits, see the page Residence permit types. If it is brought to our attention that obtaining a residence permit may have involved a serious abuse of rights, the withdrawal process may be initiated without delay. 4. If you hold an EU Blue Card but become unemployed Your EU Blue Card will be cancelled if you no longer have a valid contract for highly qualified employment (as a highly skilled worker). Your card will not be cancelled if you do not have an employment contract that is valid for up to 12 months because of an illness, disability or parental leave, or you do not meet the income requirement during a period of up to 12 months because of an illness, disability or parental leave, oryou are unemployed for up to 3 months and you have held an EU Blue Card for less than 2 years, oryou are unemployed for up to 6 months and you have held an EU Blue Card for a minimum of 2 years. 5. If a country other than Finland has imposed an entry ban into the Schengen area on you We may withdraw your residence permit if another Schengen country requests Finland to do so. This may happen if you have been prohibited from entering the Schengen area and ordered to be removed from it because of crime or because your conduct endangers safety. 6.
If you have moved away from Finland permanently Your fixed-term or permanent residence permit will be withdrawn if you move out of the country permanently or if you have continuously resided outside Finland for over 2 years for permanent purposes. If you hold a long-term resident’s EU residence permit (P-EU), it will be withdrawn if you have resided outside the territory of the European Union for 2 consecutive years or outside Finland for 6 consecutive years. We will ask for your opinion before we withdraw your permit Before a decision to withdraw your permit can be issued, we will ask you and the family member who lives in Finland to give your opinions on the possible withdrawal. You and your family member will be given an opportunity to submit a written statement on your opinions on the possible withdrawal. However, we might not need to ask for your opinion in the following cases: Your consecutive residence period outside Finland clearly exceeds 2 years. We do not know where you live and you have not given us your current contact details. The information we have suggests that your ties to Finland seem to have broken or your ties to Finland are weak. The data available in, for instance, the Finnish Population Information System, Incomes Register, and the registers of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) and of the Border Guard will be checked. If we are considering the withdrawal of your permit, we will make an individual assessment of your situation. We might not necessarily need to cancel your permit. If we decide to withdraw your residence permit and you are residing in Finland while the decision is made, you may be deported from Finland. If you are deported, an entry ban may be imposed on you. The entry ban may prohibit entry into Finland or into the entire Schengen area. You have always the right to appeal against a decision issued by the Finnish Immigration Service to an administrative court. Read more about how to appeal a decision.

Your family member must submit a separate application and pay a processing fee for it. An application to prevent the withdrawal of your residence permit may be granted only if you have been residing outside Finland temporarily and for special or exceptional reasons.

Assessment of your application As an example, below is a list of situations in which an application to prevent the withdrawal of a permit might be granted and not granted:Your application to prevent the withdrawal of a permit may be granted in, for example, the following cases:You have a fixed-term employment contract outside Finland. You have filed the application for less than 2 years after your residence outside Finland began. Your application states the date when you will return to Finland. You have returned to your home country to finish your unfinished studies. Your employment relationship in Finland is valid until further notice. You have stated in your application the exact date when you will return to Finland. In addition, your Finnish employer has confirmed that you will return to work for them as soon as you are back in Finland. If your application is granted, we will state a date by which you must return to Finland. If you do not return to Finland by the appointed day, we may initiate the process for considering the withdrawal of your permit. Your application to prevent the withdrawal of a permit might not be granted in, for example, the following cases:You have been working in a country other than Finland for almost 2 years and have estimated in your application that you will be staying outside Finland for a year or 2, after which you will return to Finland to work for the employer with whom you have an employment contract.
Your stay outside Finland is exceptionally long and your application does not state an exact date for your return to Finland. In such a case, the decision on your application is likely to be negative. You are working outside Finland because you did not find work in Finland. You have a permanent address outside Finland and your employment contract is valid until further notice. You have stated in your application that you will return to Finland in 2–3 years.
You have not stated an exact return date in your application and your residence outside Finland is permanent. In that case, the decision on your application is likely to be negative. Furthermore, an application to prevent the withdrawal of a permit cannot be granted if the application has been submitted too late, that is, over 2 years after your residence outside Finland has begun.",Cancellation of a permit

https://www.migri.fi/withdrawal-of-refugee-status-and-subsidiary-protection,"Ending of refugee status and subsidiary protection Ending refugee status The Finnish Immigration Service may end your refugee status ifyou voluntarily re-avail yourself of the protection of your country of nationality, for example, you get a national passport or voluntarily travel to your country of nationality you voluntarily settle in the country from which you fledyour personal circumstances or the circumstances in your home country have changed so that you no longer need refugee statusyou become a citizen of another state than Finland and you are able to avail yourself of the protection of this country, oryou voluntarily regain citizenship that you have previously lost. The ending of refugee status means that you will no longer have asylum in Finland. Ending subsidiary protection status The Finnish Immigration Service may end your subsidiary protection status if your personal circumstances or the circumstances in your home country have changed so that you no longer need international protection. Your subsidiary protection status can be ended for example ifyou have stated in your asylum application that you cannot return to your home country but have later voluntarily travelled therethe security situation of your home country has changed so that you no longer need subsidiary protection. Ending subsidiary protection status means that you will lose your subsidiary protection status in Finland. The Finnish Immigration Service also examines whether you have grounds for a residence permit When the Finnish Immigration Service considers ending your refugee status or subsidiary protection status, it examines whether you have grounds for your residence permit any longer. The Finnish Immigration Service also considers whether you may be deported from Finland and whether an entry ban may be imposed on you. An entry ban means that you are not allowed to return to Finland or the Schengen area. The ban is valid until further notice or for a limited period. If the Finnish Immigration Service ends your refugee status or subsidiary protection status, your residence permit can, nevertheless, remain valid. If you wish, you can also apply for a new residence permit on new grounds.
If the Finnish Immigration Service ends your refugee status or subsidiary protection status and you no longer have grounds for a residence permit in Finland, a decision to deport you will be made and you will be given the opportunity to voluntarily leave Finland within the time limit set for voluntary return. The time limit is short, usually 30 days. If you receive an entry ban, you no longer have the opportunity for voluntary return. Read more on the page Deportation and denial of admittance or stay. Travel documents when your refugee status or subsidiary protection status is ended By law, you need to have a valid travel document while you are residing in Finland. If you have been granted a refugee travel document, it will be cancelled when your refugee status is ended. You have to get the passport of your country of nationality when the decision on ending your refugee status becomes final. If you cannot get the passport of your country of nationality, you can apply for an alien’s passport. If you have an alien’s passport, the Finnish Immigration Service will consider whether to cancel your alien’s passport or keep it valid so that you can acquire the passport of your country of nationality. The process of considering ending your refugee status or subsidiary protection status:The Finnish Immigration Service becomes aware of a reason for considering ending your refugee status or subsidiary protection status. A reason could be, for example, that you have acquired the passport of your country of nationality or you have stayed in your country of nationality. The Finnish Immigration Service sends you a letter stating that it is considering ending your refugee status or subsidiary protection status.
A written hearing request is usually enclosed with the letter. Follow the instructions in the letter to answer the questions asked. The letter may also say that you will receive a separate invitation to an oral hearing after about three weeks. The oral hearing is held at the Finnish Immigration Service. The Finnish Immigration Service makes its decision on the basis of the information obtained in the hearing. Either the Finnish Immigration Service or the police will inform you of the decision. You can appeal against the decision if you want to. If your refugee status or subsidiary protection status is not ended, you can continue your stay in Finland as usual. If your refugee status or subsidiary protection status is ended,
your current residence permit can remain valid or you can apply for a new residence permit on the basis of new grounds, oryou will be deported from Finland and you must leave Finland. The Finnish Immigration Service may also impose an entry ban on you. Impact of crimes on the ending of refugee status or subsidiary protection status The Finnish Immigration Service may also consider ending your refugee status or subsidiary protection status if you commit a crime in Finland and the Finnish authorities consider you a danger to Finland’s security. When can you be deported on the basis of crimes? You can be deported from Finland on the basis of crimes and endangering Finland’s security ifyou are found guilty of an offence carrying a maximum sentence of imprisonment for a year or moreyou are found guilty of repeated offencesyou have, through your behaviour, shown that you are a danger to other people’s safetyyou have taken part, or Finnish authorities have reason to suspect that you may take part in activities that endanger Finland’s national security. If you have been granted refugee status or subsidiary protection status in Finland, further conditions for your deportation are that your refugee status or subsidiary protection status can be ended and your deportation does not violate the principle of non-refoulement.
According to the principle of non-refoulement, no one may be sent back to an area where he or she could be subject to the death penalty, torture, persecution, or other inhuman or degrading treatment.",Withdrawal of refugee status and subsidiary protection

https://www.migri.fi/en/if-an-employer-neglects-their-obligations,"If an employer neglects their obligations If an employer fails to fulfil their employer obligations, the TE Office or the Finnish Immigration Service may decide to refrain from issuing residence permits for employment in that company. An employer who employs a foreign national who does not have the right of residence or the right to work may be committing a punishable violation or offence. Financial sanction An employer who has hired an employee who is staying illegally in the country is liable to pay a financial sanction. The financial sanction ranges from EUR 1,000 to EUR 30,000 and will be imposed by the Finnish Immigration Service by virtue of the Employment Contracts Act. In some cases, the employer may be liable to compensate for the costs of returning an employee who has been staying illegally in the country. Employer’s violation of the Aliens Act Examples of cases where an employer may be committing a violation of the Aliens Act: An employer who deliberately or through negligence employs a foreign national who does not have the right to perform the type of gainful employment he or she is performing. An employer who deliberately or through gross negligence gives false or misleading information to the authorities on a foreign employee’s terms of employment or duties.
Refraining from issuing residence permits on the basis of work In some cases, the Finnish Immigration Service or the TE Office may issue a separate decision on refraining from issuing residence permits on the basis of work for a certain employer. If such decision has been made and it is still valid when a foreign national applies for a residence permit on the basis of work in the service of that employer, the employee will receive a negative decision on the application. A decision to refrain from issuing permits is valid for three to twelve months. The decision on refraining from issuing permits may be appealed against by the employer.
Employers of people who apply for a residence permit on the basis of work A decision to refrain from issuing permits may be made if the employer has given false or misleading information on, for instance, the collective agreement applicable to an employee’s employment relationship, on the employer's ability to meet their obligations as an employer, or on the principal terms of work. The principal terms of work include: the employee's main duties; the grounds for the determination of pay, and the pay period; the working hours to be observed; the professional field in which the employee will work. A decision to refrain from issuing permits may be made if the information that the employer has given is clearly false or highly misleading and if the employer has not corrected that information within the given time limit despite being asked to do so. Further, a decision to refrain from issuing permits may be made if the employer has been sentenced for an employer’s violation of the Aliens Act due to giving, deliberately or through gross negligence, false or misleading information to the authorities on a foreign employee’s terms of employment or duties and the requirements of these duties. The sentence imposed must have become final. Employers of seasonal workers A decision to refrain from issuing permits may be made if the employer has fundamentally neglected their employer obligations. Examples of cases when an employer of seasonal workers may be neglecting their obligations: The terms of employment of a seasonal worker do not comply with the applicable collective agreement. A seasonal worker is not provided with appropriate accommodation that ensures an adequate standard of living if the employer is responsible for providing accommodation. Further, a decision to refrain from issuing permits may be made if a seasonal worker's seasonal work permit has been refused for reasons related to the employer. Examples of such reasons: Sanctions have been imposed on the employer for an infringement of employer obligations or for illegal work. The employer has failed to comply with the obligations imposed on an employer in legislation or in a collective agreement, when these obligations concern social security, taxation, workers' rights, working conditions or terms of employment.",If an employer neglects their obligations 
https://www.migri.fi/en/certified-employers,"Certified employers When employer certification is granted to your company, the name of your company will be added to the list of certified employers. The list of certified employers will be updated weekly. Your company will be removed from the list if the employer certification expires and the company has not applied for an extension. Moreover, a company may be removed from the list if deficiencies in the employer’s activities are detected and the withdrawal of certification is being considered. What is a certified employer? Certification proves that a company meets certain requirements as an employer. It speeds up the processing of an application for a residence permit for an employed person. The employees must still apply for their residence permits themselves and meet the requirements for the permit. Certification does not impact the processing fee for a residence permit application. The Finnish Immigration Service is required to publish a list of certified employers. List of certified employers is not a job advertisement If a company’s name is on the list, it does not mean that the company has vacancies.

Dublin procedure The European countries have agreed that an asylum application is only examined by one country.

If the authorities in that country decide that Finland is responsible for examining the application, your family member will be transferred to Finland. Your family member will not be issued with a residence permit automatically. His or her asylum application will be processed and decided in Finland. The Finnish Immigration Service cannot influence the other state’s decision to start the Dublin procedure or the procedure itself. If your family member applies for a residence permit in Finland, it will not affect the Dublin procedure. Applying for a residence permit on the basis of family ties Your family member can apply for a residence permit on the basis of family ties. Your family member can submit his or her residence permit application to a Finnish mission (embassy or consulate), even when the authorities in the country where he or she resides are still considering the Dublin procedure.

If your studies take at least two years, your insurance must cover pharmaceutical expenses up to EUR 40,000. In other words, the shorter your studies will take, the more extensive insurance coverage you will need. For example, an exchange student needs more comprehensive insurance than a degree student. Where can I take out acceptable insurance? When you are outside Finland, you can take out insurance from an insurance company in your home country. Alternatively, you may ask for suitable insurance from an international insurance company. You can also look into insurance providers that offer international health insurance for students. For instance the following insurance companies offer students insurance contracts that meet the requirements for granting a residence permit for studies:the French company Assurances Courtages et Services (ACS) (www. acs-ami. com)Aon Student Insurance, whose parent company is the US company Aon Corporation (https://www. aonstudentinsurance. com)the US company International Student Insurance (www. internationalstudentinsurance. com)the Swiss insurance company Swisscare – ESI Finland plan (https://swisscare. com/) SIP Integral (https://www. sipinsurance. eu) We assess each insurance policy and its terms and conditions individually when we process residence permit applications. The insurance policy must include at least the following information:your personal detailsperiod of validity of insurancegeographical area in which your insurance is validinsurance coverageinsured amounts amount of excess, or a mention that there is no excess. European Health Insurance Card If you have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), you do not need to take out other insurance. By presenting the European Health Insurance Card, you can prove your right to necessary medical treatment in another EU or EEA country and in Switzerland. Your card must be valid for the duration of your stay in Finland. Under EU legislation, you can access health care at the same cost and under the same conditions as people living permanently in Finland. With the card, you can get medical treatment if you become suddenly ill or have an accident. You can also get medical treatment if you have a chronic illness that requires medical attention. The card also gives access to necessary treatment during pregnancy and childbirth. The European Health Insurance Card is recognised within the public health care services as well as by private doctors and hospitals that have signed a health insurance agreement. More information on the European Health Insurance Card can be found on the website of the website of the European Commission (ec. europa. eu).",Insurance 
https://www.migri.fi/visiting-finland,"Visiting Finland (Visa)If you wish to visit Finland, for example as a tourist, or stay with relatives or friends, or make a business or conference trip, you will generally need a visa. A visa is a permit to enter the country for a short-term or temporary period of residence lasting no more than 90 days. If you intend to reside in Finland for other purposes, you have to apply for a residence permit. You will not need a visa if you are a citizen of a Nordic country or an EU Member State. Similarly, no visa is required if you are a citizen of a visa-free country and you have a valid passport or a comparable travel document. When you wish to stay in Finland for over 90 days, you need to apply for a first residence permit abroad and wait for the decision there before you come to Finland. If you visit Finland while your residence permit application is still pending, you must travel back to your home country when your visa-free period ends or when your visa expires. Applications for a first residence permit can be submitted in Finland only in certain exceptional situations. Read more about how to apply for a first residence permit.
Do you have questions about travelling? Please see the frequently asked questions and the instructions on the website of the Finnish Border Guard. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is responsible for visas You may apply for a visa outside Finland from a Finnish embassy operating under the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland. Finnish embassies also make decisions on the granting of visas. Information on visa application, period of validity and visa fees can be found on the website of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland. Working in Finland You may also need a residence permit for short-term (less than 90 days) work in Finland. In certain cases, you are allowed to work without a residence permit. If your seasonal work is going to last for less than three months and you need a visa to come to Finland, apply for a seasonal work visa at a Finnish mission (embassy or consulate).",Visiting Finland 
https://www.migri.fi/en/reception-allowance,"Reception allowance If you are an asylum seeker or have applied for or been granted temporary protection, you may get reception allowance. Reception allowance is money intended for the immediate basic needs of you and your family. You can be granted reception allowance if you or your family members do not have enough income and funds to cover your immediate basic needs, such as food and clothing. Reception allowance is not granted automatically. You can apply for the allowance from your own reception centre by filling in an application form. Your reception centre can give you the application form and instructions for applying. The reception allowance consists of the basic component and the supplementary reception allowance. The basic component of the reception allowance is intended for clothing, minor health care costs, expenses on the use of local transport, and telephone costs, for example. The basic component is also intended for food costs if the reception centre does not offer daily meals. In addition to the basic component, you can apply for supplementary reception allowance for the special needs of you and your family. Your income and funds affect the amount of your reception allowance All income and funds that you and your family have at your disposal affect the amount of the reception allowance. Even all income and funds you receive from abroad affect the amount of the reception allowance, if you have the income and funds at your disposal in Finland. When you apply for the reception allowance, you have a legal obligation to report to the reception centre all your income and funds. Income means any monetary income, such as salary or wages, tax refunds or money gifted to you by a relative, for example. Funds can mean, for instance, cash, savings in a bank account or any assets and property of value that you can sell. The amount of the reception allowance is always determined individually on the basis of the needs and funds of the person or family. Your reception centre will make a calculation of the amount of reception allowance you are entitled to. Your income and the funds you have at your disposal will be taken into account in the calculation. Under law, a maximum of 150 euros of your wage income may be excluded from the calculation, meaning that this sum does not reduce the amount of your reception allowance. The rest of your wage income will still affect the amount of the reception allowance. Under law, a maximum of 50 euros of other income than wage income may also be excluded from the calculation, meaning that this sum does not reduce the amount of your reception allowance. For a family, the corresponding sum is 100 euros. The calculation will regard as expenses the basic component of the reception allowance and your work-related expenses if you have a job. Housing costs will not be covered If you live in private accommodation, your housing costs, such as rent, electricity and water expenses, will not be paid for. Housing or organizing your housing is not financially supported. Will travelling affect my reception allowance? The reception allowance is meant for persons residing in Finland. Travelling abroad may affect your right to receive reception allowance. If you apply for reception allowance and intend to travel outside Finland, inform your reception centre of your trip. Children who are in Finland without a guardian are paid spending allowance Reception centres that are intended for children, so called units for minors, secure the living of unaccompanied minors by arranging full board and lodging for children who are in Finland without their guardian. Units for minors take care of the children’s necessary expenses and additional costs related to their special needs such as hobbies and studies. Children who live in a unit for minors receive spending allowance instead of reception allowance. The spending allowance is intended for the child’s personal expenses. It is not used to secure the child’s living. Unaccompanied minors who live in private accommodation or in a supported housing unit for persons over 16 years of age are paid reception allowance. The amount of this reception allowance is the same as it is for adults living alone.",Reception allowance

If you need medical help, he or she will send you to a doctor. When you move to a reception centre for the first time, you have the opportunity to undergo a health examination. The purpose of the health care services is to help you stay as healthy as possible, both physically and mentally, and prevent illness.

For example, information sessions organised by the reception centre will be interpreted into a language that you understand. An interpreter is often booked for your visits to the nurse, the social worker or the social counsellor. The interpreter may not necessarily interpret into your mother tongue if there is another language that you understand sufficiently well. The reception centre will not book an interpreter for all everyday situations. Instead, everyone should make an effort to make do without an interpreter. Interpreters and translators always have an obligation to maintain secrecy. You will find more information about the roles of the authorities and the interpreter in a video produced by the project At Home in Finland. The video has not been made by the Finnish Immigration Service, and therefore the practices at some of the appointments at the Finnish Immigration Service may differ from those described on the video.

If you refuse to attend, your financial support may be reduced. The work and study activities do not mean a paid job outside the reception centre. If you want to have a paid job, read more about an asylum seeker’s right to work. Most often, the study activities are studies in the Finnish or Swedish language. The work activities are organised by the reception centre, and the work is done at the reception centre. The work consists of everyday tasks such as maintaining the yard or cleaning. Before your work and study activities begin, the reception centre will make a personal work and study activity plan with you. You need to sign the plan. Basic course on the Finnish society Every asylum seeker must take a basic course on the Finnish society, as a part of his or her work and study activities. The course will give you a basic knowledge on the Finnish society and the ways it operates. More information about the course Right to basic and pre-primary education The Finnish law grants the children who live in reception centres the right to participate in basic education. The municipality in which the reception centre is located organises basic education for all children who live in that municipality and who are of compulsory school age. The municipality also organises pre-primary education for children who will reach the compulsory school age in the coming year.

https://www.migri.fi/asylum-seeker-s-right-to-work,"Asylum seeker’s right to work As an asylum seeker, you are permitted employment only if you have a valid right to work. When you find a job, you must check whether your right to work has begun and whether it is still in force. You must tell your employer immediately if your right to work is terminated. You may be committing an offence if you are employed but do not have the right to work. Where can you find information on your right to work? In the application process, asylum seekers are given a brochure, Asylum seeker's right to work. The decision you receive will contain information about your right to work. If you are unsure of your right to work, you can ask the Finnish Immigration Service about your right to work by email. See the instructions on the page Information about right to work. For what kind of work do you need to have the right to work? You need to have a valid right to work if you get paid for your work. Internship You need to have a valid right to work if you get paid for your work as an intern. Vaikka työnteko-oikeutesi ei olisi voimassa, voit tehdä työtä, josta et saa palkkaa. Such work includes, for example, unpaid internship as part of your studies or training organised by Employment and Economic Development Offices andvoluntary work organised by non-governmental organisations and associations. Finnish law does not provide for unpaid internships other than as part of studies or training organised by Employment and Economic Development Offices. You should always receive an appropriate salary for your internship or work. Unpaid internships always involve the possible risk of exploitation. Apprenticeship agreement You must have a valid right to work when you are working under an apprenticeship agreement and receive a salary or some other compensation for working. An apprenticeship agreement is a fixed-term employment contract during which the employer will provide training for an occupation. You cannot work as an entrepreneur, a light entrepreneur or a freelancer without a residence permit According to the Aliens Act, an asylum seeker is allowed to accept gainful employment in Finland. Gainful employment means working in an employment relationship under your employer’s direction and supervision in return of salary or some other compensation. As an asylum seeker, you cannot work as an entrepreneur, a light entrepreneur or a freelancer without a valid residence permit. You are considered to be a light entrepreneur (‘kevytyrittäjä’ in Finnish) if you employ yourself and perform entrepreneurial activitiesyou provide services or sell products to your own customers through a platform company or an invoicing service company.
Such companies include, for example, Foodora, Freska, Uber, Wolt, Ukko and Free.
There is no separate residence permit for freelancers or for light entrepreneurs. You may, however, work as a freelancer or a light entrepreneur if you have a valid residence permit or a municipality of residence in Finland. If you have applied for asylum in Finland, you cannot get a residence permit for an entrepreneur while staying in Finland when your application is being processed or after receiving a negative decision. This applies to all asylum seekers staying in Finland regardless of when they have submitted their asylum application or received a negative decision on their application. If you want to apply for a residence permit for an entrepreneur, you need to leave Finland and visit a Finnish mission (embassy or consulate) in your home country or country of permanent residence to apply for the permit. For more information about applying for a residence permit, see the pages Coming to Finland for work and Residence permit application for an entrepreneur. When does the right to work begin? You are allowed to find paid employment after either three or six months have passed following your application for asylum. The waiting period is three months if you have presented a valid passport or other travel document to the authorities, and it has been verified as genuine. The waiting period is six months if you have not presented a travel document. How does a re-application affect the right to work? If you submit a re-application you will have to wait another three or six months before you can work again. A re-application is an application submitted by an asylum seeker who has already received a decision on at least one earlier asylum application. The waiting period is three months if you have presented a valid passport or other travel document to the authorities, and it has been verified as genuine. The waiting period is six months if you have not presented a travel document. If you submitted a re-application before 1 June 2019, you may continue working. How long can the employment continue? When you receive a decision, you must check whether your right to work is still valid. The decision will tell you this. Was your asylum application accepted? If your application was accepted, in most cases you may continue to work in Finland. Your residence permit card or decision will tell you whether you have the right to work in Finland. Was your asylum application rejected? The decision always contains information about whether your right to work will end or continue. Right to work if the Finnish Immigration Service has issued a decision on 1 September 2024 or later If you receive a negative decision, your right to work is valid during the appeal period, which is 30 days from the date on which the decision of the Finnish Immigration Service was served on you.

If the administrative court rejects your appeal in respect of international protection, your right to work ends on the day when the decision of the administrative court is served on you. If the administrative court overturns the decision of the Finnish Immigration Service in respect of international protection and returns your application to the Finnish Immigration Service, your right to work will continue at least until the Finnish Immigration Service issues a new decision on the matter. The decision will contain information about your right to work. If the administrative court rejects your appeal in respect of international protection but returns the matter to the Finnish Immigration Service for some other reason, your right to work ends when the decision of the administrative court is served on you.
If the Finnish Immigration Service has applied an accelerated procedure to your asylum application or considered your application inadmissible, your right to work ends on the day when the decision of the Finnish Immigration Service is served on you. If your right to work has ended, it will not begin again if you apply for leave to appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court.

Employers are required by law to verify the right to work An employer must verify that a foreign employee has the required residence permit for an employed person or that the employee is not required to have a residence permit. An employer may be committing an offence or a violation if he or she deliberately or negligently employs an employee who does not have the right to work.

Employers can ask about their employees’ right to work free of charge by sending an email message to the Finnish Immigration Service. See the instructions on the page Information about right to work. Occupational safety and health authorities monitor the employer’s obligation to verify that a foreign employee has the right to work: Right to work – Occupational safety and health.

Assistance and donations Transportation Offering accommodation Assistance and donations I would like to organise a collection or donate clothing, toys or other items to those arriving from Ukraine. Who should I contact? The primary way to offer your help is to contact reliable volunteer organisations, for example. Many organisations have organised their own collections. However, if you want to donate items directly to a reception centre, contact your local reception centre before bringing any donations. For contact details of reception centres, see the page Reception centres. The reception centre will tell you whether any items and goods are needed at the moment. The reception centre will also give you more detailed instructions on what type of items are welcome. Please make sure that the donated items are in good condition and sorted out beforehand. Any items you donate to a reception centre are intended for all clients of the reception centre. Transportation I will be offering transportation to Finland for Ukrainians who have fled the Russian military attack. Who should I contact? We are asking all voluntary transport organisers providing transport for Ukrainian nationals from Ukraine to Finland to submit preliminary passenger information to the Finnish Immigration Service. Be prepared to provide the following information:How many Ukrainians are arriving by your transportation? Report the number of passengers only. Do not provide any personal details on this form. What is the final destination of the passenger in Finland? Will the persons stay in Finland visa-free or will they apply for asylum? If the persons are applying for asylum, will they be staying at a reception centre or in private accommodation?

The Finnish Immigration Service coordinates accommodation for asylum seekers only. Offering accommodation I own a property or housing facilities I'd like to offer to Ukrainians in Finland. How should I proceed? At the moment, the Finnish Immigration Service is not looking to receive new offers for accommodation facilities. One way to help is to contact reliable volunteer organisations. I can accommodate Ukrainians in my own home or apartment. What things should I know? People applying for asylum or temporary protection are always able to stay at a reception centre. However, people applying for asylum or temporary protection can also organise accommodation by themselves. This is called private accommodation. Usually this means staying with one’s relatives, spouse or friends. Private accommodation can mean living in a rented or sublet apartment. Asylum seekers can also live in a private person’s home

Staying in private accommodation If you wish, you may find another place to stay. If you live in private accommodation, for example with relatives, friends or your spouse, you still need to be registered at a reception centre. Your reception centre will give you the reception services that belong to you, such as health care services and a reception allowance. Living in private accommodation is not possible if the Finnish Immigration Service applies the border procedure to your application. During the border procedure, you are not allowed to leave the area of the reception centre. For more information, see the page Border procedure. Tell your reception centre if you find private accommodation If you want to live in private accommodation, you must give your new address in a written document to the reception centre where you are registered. You must also show your rental agreement or another document of your accommodation. Doing this is a condition for receiving other reception services. You have to live in the address that you give to the reception centre. Remember to always keep in touch with your reception centre:You should stay in contact with the reception centre where you are registered. The reception centre will offer you reception services and give you plenty of important information and instructions. Always notify your reception centre if your address or your contact details change. If you move, you must also show your new rental agreement or another document of your accommodation. It is extremely important that the reception centre is always able to reach you if necessary. Keeping your contact information up to date is a condition for receiving reception services. If the reception centre tries to contact you several times but cannot reach you, the centre may conclude that you have disappeared. In that case, your asylum application will expire. You should also frequently read the customer bulletins of the Finnish Immigration Service. We use our bulletins to tell about any changes that apply to asylum seekers or reception centres.",Living in private accommodation

The representative’s task is to ensure that the child’s best interests are taken into account in different situations. The Finnish Immigration Service will pay the representative’s fee. The representative uses the right of action that belongs to the guardian of a minor child, helps the child with official matters or takes care of the child’s matters on his or her behalf with the Finnish authorities. For example, the representative participates in the child’s asylum interview which is a part of the processing of his or her asylum application. The representative is not responsible for the daily maintenance, upbringing or other care of the child. These matters are the responsibility of the reception centre.

https://www.migri.fi/faq-online-service,"Frequently asked questions: Online service Enter Finland Using the online service Attachments Messages from the online service How the online service works Strong identification Using the online service How do I use Enter Finland? For instructions on how to use the online service, see the page Online services. Attachments It is possible to upload only one document as an attachment, but I have several files that concern the same matter. How can I combine my files into a single document? Open the files with a word-processing programme (for example Word) and combine them into a single document. If possible, save the document as a PDF file. You can combine images in the same way. If you have an image-processing programme, you can use it to combine images. Do not reduce the file size too much so that the files are easy to read. Remember to pay attention to data security, especially if you use a public computer or programmes available on websites. You can also watch this video: Adding documents to your application in Enter Finland The maximum size for an attachment is 4 megabytes but my files are larger than that. How can I make them smaller? You can reduce the file size of your documents when scanning them. In the scanner settings, select 150 dpi as resolution, for instance. Resolution regulates the level of detail in the scanned image. If the attachment is an image, you can reduce its size by opening the file in an image processing programme, reduce the size of the image and then save the file again. How can I expedite an application so that it will be processed urgently? Read more about requests to expedite on the website migri. fi. Messages from the online service I received an automatic message from Enter Finland. When does Enter Finland send automatic messages, and can I stop them? A notification is sent by email and text message in the following situations: 1) A request for additional information has been sent to you. 2) You have been sent a decision to read. 3) The additional information you submitted has been received. 4) Your reply to a request for additional information has been received. 5) A status message is sent to you every three weeks (residence permit applications) or every three months (citizenship applications) until a decision has been made on the application. Automatic messages cannot be turned off. I did not receive an automatic message when I was supposed to. For example I didn't receive a message when I replied to a supplement request. How can I know for sure that you have received my reply? You can be sure that we have received your reply if the application events show that the reply has been sent and if the application attachments contain the documents you have sent. We cannot guarantee that the automatic messages will be delivered successfully. That is why we always recommend that you check the status of your application yourself by logging in every once in a while. How the online service works The application form asks for a family identification code. What is it and where can I get it? Some application forms ask for a family identification code. With the help of the code, applications can become pending automatically and be linked together in our system when family members are applying for a permit at the same time. You can get a family identification code only if you have stated in your application that your family member is applying for a residence permit at the same time as you. Include the email address of your family member in your application, and we will send the code to the email address. When your family member has received the code, he or she has to include it in his or her own application. The family identification code is not mandatory. You can submit your application without a code. Submitting your application without a code will not delay the processing of your application. How can I make sure that the document I sent to you in Enter Finland has been received? You can be sure that we have received your documents if the application events show that the reply has been sent and if the application attachments contain the documents you have sent. According to Enter Finland, the processing ground of my application has been changed. What does it mean? Choosing the right application form can sometimes be difficult. For example, if an applicant who has applied for a residence permit for an employed person could get a residence permit as a specialist, we will process the application according to the processing ground where the waiting time is shorter and the decision more likely to be positive. However, this change is made only when it benefits the applicant and when the basic reason for applying stays the same (employment, family ties, studies). For example, a residence permit application on the basis of family ties is never processed as a residence permit application for employment. The information about a changed processing ground is not visible in Enter Finland, which is why the application events and the estimated processing time may no longer be valid for your application. However, the information on whether or not there has been a decision will always be shown correctly in Enter Finland. I declared when applying that my employer will use Enter Finland for Employers but I heard they can’t use it after all. What should I do? In that case, you yourself should submit the documents and information your employer was supposed to provide, such as your employment contract or the ‘Terms of employment’ form. To submit the documents, use the link 'Send additional information' in Enter Finland. For a detailed list of all the required documents, see our website or the final section of the paper application. Do not make a new application. Why can't I change my name and date of birth when I'm filling in an application? These two pieces of information appear on your application exactly as you have entered them into your user account. You gave this information when you created your account. If your name has changed, first change your name on the 'My account' page. Then fill in your application again. Please remember that you can only use this service to apply for a residence permit or an EU registration for yourself, or to apply for a permanent residence permit or a residence permit on the basis of family ties for a child who is in your care. Your employer or spouse cannot submit an application on your behalf. How do I get a certificate of a pending application from Enter Finland?

https://www.migri.fi/faq-online-service,"Strong identification What does strong identification mean? Strong identification means proving your identity online. You are using strong identification when you log in to the online service Enter Finland with your Finnish online banking credentials, mobile certificate or Citizen Certificate. How to use strong identification in Enter Finland? Log in to the online service Enter Finland using your Finnish online banking credentials, Citizen Certificate or mobile certificate. When you log in to the online service with one of these three options, you are using strong identification. What is the difference between banking credentials, a mobile certificate and a Citizen Certificate? You will get banking credentials from your bank when you sign an agreement with the bank. Banking credentials are your electronic identity document. A mobile certificate, also called the Mobile ID, is the certificate in the SIM card of your phone. You can start using the mobile certificate by contacting your mobile service provider. For more information about the mobile certificate, visit the website ‘Mobiilivarmenne’. The Citizen Certificate is contained in the personal identity card issued by the police or, if you are abroad, a Finnish mission (embassy or consulate). For more information about the Citizen Certificate, see the website of the Digital and Population Data Services Agency. Why should I use strong identification in Enter Finland? By using strong identification, you can prove your identity online and pay for your application safely in Enter Finland.

Select ‘Change now’ to get to the Suomi. fi login page. There you can log in to the online service using strong electronic identification, for example your Finnish online banking credentials. After you have logged in to the service using online banking credentials, for example, your account is upgraded to an account that uses strong identification. From now on, you will always have to use this new login method when you log in to your account. Remember to change the login method of your account before you submit your application. If you submit your application before you change the login method, you will unfortunately have to visit a service point. I submitted my application by email. Can I change the application to an application with strong identification afterwards? Can I avoid visiting a service point that way? If you change your login method from email to online banking credentials or other form of strong identification only after you have submitted your application, it is not possible to avoid having to visit a service point. How do I know if I need to visit a service point? Enter Finland will tell you whether you need to visit a service point or not If you do not need to visit a service point, Enter Finland will show you the following message:""You do not need to visit a service point Congratulations, your application is now pending!

However, it will take more of your time. When you use strong identification, you may not have to visit a service point at all when applying for an extended permit. Can I avoid visiting a service point when I am applying for a residence permit or Finnish citizenship? Unfortunately, you will have to visit a service point when you apply for a first residence permit or a permanent residence permit. If you apply for Finnish citizenship and there are no children under 18 years of age as your co-applicants, you may avoid having to visit a service point. Read more on the page Identification.

https://www.migri.fi/faq-application-forms,"Frequently asked questions: Application forms Frequently asked questions Filling the application Residence permit application forms Frequently asked questions The form says that appendices should be translated into Finnish, Swedish or English by an authorised translator. How do I know that the translator I use is an authorised translator? Should the translator’s status be demonstrated in some way? In Finland authorised translators use a special stamp. Investigate the practice adopted in your own country. The demand for an official or authorised translator arises from the need to be able to have faith in the translation. Investigating doubts concerning the quality of translation lengthens the time for processing. The form requires a clarification of income to be appended. Does this kind of document need to be translated? How do I know which documents need to be translated and which don’t? You must obtain an authorised translation of all documents to be appended to your application that are in a language other than Finnish, Swedish or English. What is a travel document? Is an air ticket a travel document? An air ticket is not a travel document. The most common travel document is a national passport. A travel document may also be an official, diplomatic or alien’s passport or a refugee’s travel document. I would like to move to Finland, but none of the forms seems to suit my circumstances. What should I do? Before you can apply for a residence permit you must have grounds for making an application as outlined in the Finnish Aliens Act. The Aliens Act contains restrictions regarding the grounds on which a permit may be granted. The most common grounds for obtaining right of residence are study, work, self-employment or family ties with Finland. If you have an ‘other special reason’ for residing in Finland and are yourself taking care of the cost of residence here, complete form OLE_MUU. The granting of a permit is at the discretion of the authorities. ‘Other special reason’ may include, for example, an established intimate relationship with the intention of getting married. Travel, however, does not fall into this category. Which certificates must be legalised? If required as attachments to residence permit or citizenship applications, certificates of family ties must be legalised, unless they have been issued by authorities in one of the Nordic countries or in an EU Member State. Such certificates include certificates of marriage and registered partnership. Death certificates and certificates of guardianship must also be legalised. Legalisation is a standard procedure applicable to foreign documents. Legalisation is a way of ensuring that the party issuing the certificate is entitled to do so under the laws of the issuing country and that the issued document contains the appropriate information and is valid in the country of issue. Filling in the application Do I need the programme Adobe Acrobat®Reader? To fill in the application, you need Acrobat Reader. You can download the programme for free here. You can fill in the PDF-form online straight away or download the form to your computer and continue filling in the application later. There are some parts of the form I don’t know how to fill in. Can I leave these blank? Answer to the best of your knowledge. If parts of the form are incomplete it will slow down the application process, as at some stage we will need to ask you to supply the missing information. If we do not receive the necessary information the application may be rejected and a permit cannot be granted. Advice can be obtained from customer service at the Finnish Immigration Service or a Finnish mission abroad. The boxes on the form are too small for me to fit in the text I need to enter. What should I do? If you run out of space on the form, take a blank piece of paper and enter the rest of your information there. Mark on the paper the question to which your information refers. Enter the name of the paper on the list of appendices and clarifications contained on the last page of the application and tick the box alongside. I noticed that I entered one detail incorrectly on my application. Am I right in assuming it won’t make much difference? You must communicate every incorrect or outdated detail of information as soon as possible to the place where you submitted your application. The smallest of details, where relevant, may affect the outcome of your application. If you do not correct the information in your application, it may lead to being interpreted as providing false information. The provision of false personal information and false written documentation to the authorities is an act punishable under the Criminal Code in Finland, and may later have a bearing on whether residence in Finland is granted or not. My address has changed. Whom should I inform? The authority to whom you submitted your application should be notified of all changes to contact details. The application form asks if I have been convicted of any crime. I have been given several parking tickets. Should I enter these on the form? You application should include all punishable offences for which you have been found guilty. If you have several parking tickets, you do not need to list them all. You can enter a summary in your application which shows the total number of tickets and amount of fines. Residence permit application forms I have applied for a residence permit on the basis of employment but so far I have not obtained a decision. I have just got married to a Finn. Do I need to fill in another form? You do not need to fill in a new application, unless you wish to change the grounds for your residence permit application. You must, however, inform the Finnish Immigration Service of your marriage. This is especially important if you are changing your name. Send a certified copy of your marriage certificate to the Finnish Immigration Service, either directly or via a Finnish embassy. Certificates issued by authorities of countries other than Finland must be legalised. If the certificate is not in Finnish, Swedish, or English, please also send a translation of the certificate in one of these languages, certified by an authorised translator I am 17 years old and my father lives in Finland. Which form do I need to apply for a residence permit? If your father is your official guardian, then he or your other guardian may apply for a residence permit for you using form OLE_PH4. Confirm with your signature that the information entered on the form is correct. Both of your guardians must also complete the form regarding clarification of family ties. A guardian resident in Finland should complete form PK4_plus. A guardian resident abroad should complete form PH4_plus. I lived in Finland until a few years ago and am now moving back there. Do I need to fill in the same form again or can you refer to the information I gave before? If you do not have a valid residence permit for Finland you must complete a form according to the basis for application and submit it to a Finnish mission abroad, together with the appendices mentioned on the form. My first residence permit is expiring shortly. Where do I apply for an extension, and what form do I use? The form you select depends on the basis on which you are applying for the extension. A guide to selecting the right form can be found here. Why am I required to enter the details of my spouse on the form, when I am the one applying for a permit? Details of your marriage and your spouse belong to the kind of information we require to process your residence permit application. The information is necessary in case your spouse wishes to apply for a residence permit at a later date. If you do not provide the information now, the information will conflict with the details on your spouse’s application and slow the application process. You must also notify any further changes, for example in your family relationships, such as the birth of a child. Such information may influence the processing of your application. For how long must my passport be valid when I am applying for a residence permit? The validity period of your first residence permit may not exceed the validity period of your passport. For example, if you are applying for a residence permit for one year, your passport must be valid for at least one year from the date the permit is granted. Can I submit my application by post? No, you cannot. The application must be submitted in person. Submit your application at a Finnish mission (embassy or consulate) abroad before coming to Finland. If you are already in Finland, submit your application at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service. How do I book an appointment at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service? Book an appointment at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service in advance in our appointment system. Fill in the application form in the e-service Enter Finland or fill in a paper form before visiting the service point.",Application forms 
https://www.migri.fi/faq-family,"Frequently asked questions: Family Residence permit for a spouse Residence permit for other relative Residence permit for a child Rights Family member of a recipient of international protection Residence permit for a spouse I have a residence permit granted by the state of Finland. My spouse also wishes to move to Finland. She is not an EU citizen or equivalent. How should we proceed? Your spouse may apply for a Finnish residence permit on the basis of family ties. May I complete a residence permit application in Finland on behalf of my spouse? You may not apply for a residence permit on your spouse’s behalf. Only the applicant may initiate a residence permit application. Do the same instructions and practices apply to people in a registered relationship as to married couples? Yes. Two people of the same sex who have registered their relationship are also considered as spouses. May my cohabiting partner, who is not an EU citizen or equivalent, be granted a Finnish residence permit on the basis of family ties? A cohabiting partner may apply for a residence permit on the basis of family ties on certain conditions. If you are not sure what application form you should use, use the Application Finder to find out. I am in an established intimate relationship with a foreigner who is not an EU citizen or equivalent. We plan to marry. May my partner be granted a Finnish residence permit for the purpose of marrying? In accordance with the Finnish Aliens Act, a partner is not considered a family member and therefore a residence permit is generally not granted on this basis. However, in special cases a partner may be granted a residence permit. This requires a special reason. In some cases a residence permit may be granted on the basis of, for example, cohabitation, if the foreigner is coming to Finland to marry. I’m in an established relationship with a foreign national who is not an EU citizen or a similar person. Can she/he enter Finland with a visa and apply for a residence permit after we get married? Your partner may visit Finland with a visa if the conditions for granting a visa are met, or without a visa if she/he is exempt from the visa requirement. A Finnish mission (um. fi) abroad decides whether a visa is granted. If your partner intends to move to Finland, she must apply for her first residence permit outside Finland. She must also wait for the decision outside Finland. Your spouse may submit an application for a first residence permit in Finland if one of the following applies:You are a Finnish citizen. You have a residence permit for studies. You have a residence permit for a researcher. ‘Spouse’ refers to your wife or husband, your registered same-sex partner or your cohabiting partner who you have lived with for at least 2 years in a marriage-like relationship or with whom you have joint custody of a child. My spouse is about to apply for a residence permit on the basis of work. I’m going to apply for a residence permit on the basis of family ties. Can we submit our applications at the same time? Will we also get our decisions at the same time? You can submit your applications at the same time. However, it is possible that you will receive your decision later than your spouse. There are many reasons for this: The processing time requirement for applications submitted on the basis of work or studies is stricter than for applications submitted by family members. It takes a longer time to process family members’ applications, as their processing includes more stages that require manual work. Due to the large number of applications, there are currently backlogs in the processing of applications submitted by family members. When an application has been submitted on the basis of family ties, the processing time provided by law is nine months. You can speed up the processing of your application by making sure that you have filled in your application completely and added the necessary attachments and can present legalised documents concerning your family ties. Residence permit for other relative May my parents be granted a Finnish residence permit? Relatives other than members of the nuclear family may in some cases be granted a residence permit on the basis of family ties. The permit may be granted only to other relatives of a Finnish citizen or a person who has received international protection. If the close family life of the applicant and of the relative living in Finland has previously been discontinued for normal family reasons – for example, when an adult child has begun family life with his or her spouse – the residence permit may not be granted on the grounds of resuming close family life. Residence permits are primarily intended to be granted on the above grounds if an elderly parent moves to Finland at the same time as his or her adult child. If the application for a residence permit is submitted after the adult child has moved to Finland, the discontinuation of family life must have taken place for compelling reasons, such as for living in exile as a refugee. Even in such cases the efforts to resume the close family life must begin immediately after the adult child has arrived in Finland and established contact with the relative. A permit may also be granted if the close relative is fully dependent on the person residing in Finland. Dependence on a person (sponsor) residing in Finland refers to both physical and mental dependence; financial dependence alone does not constitute full dependence. Those falling within this group generally include the elderly parents of adults residing in Finland as well as adult children and unmarried siblings. Residence permits are not generally granted on the basis of poor health and need for treatment if the applicant has the opportunity to receive treatment for his or her condition in the home country. If the applicant’s poor health is stated as a reason for the application, relevant medical certificates must be appended to the application. Residence permit for a child Must a child born in Finland, also a baby, hold a passport issued by his or her country of nationality before one can apply for a first residence permit for the child? The time limit for applying for a residence permit for a child is 3 months of the child being born. If the child’s country of nationality has an embassy or a consulate in Finland, the child must obtain a passport issued by his or her country of nationality. If the child is born in Finland and it is not possible to get a passport from the child’s country of nationality in Finland, the child can be exempted from the passport requirement. The child can be issued with an alien’s passport so that he or she can obtain a passport issued by his or her country of nationality. The child must have a passport issued by his or her country of nationality at the latest when an application for an extended permit for the child is submitted. How soon after the birth of a child in Finland does the residence permit application have to be submitted? The application must be submitted within three months of the child’s birth. Does the child, even a baby, have to be present in person when the application is submitted? Usually, the child must be present when the application is submitted at a mission or at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service. However, the child does not have to be personally present, if there is a weighty medical reason why the child cannot be present. Can anyone else besides the child’s parent or guardian or other legal representative fill in and submit the residence permit application if given power of attorney? Yes, provided that the child’s parent or guardian or other legal representative of the child has given a power of attorney to the person. In such a case, a power of attorney with signature must be attached to the application. Please note that the child must be present when the application is submitted at a Finnish mission abroad or at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service in Finland. This requirement applies to all children under the age of 18, including babies. Rights I have a residence permit for Finland on the basis of family ties. May I work and study in Finland? If you have a residence permit granted on the basis of family ties, you have the right to gainful employment and study without restrictions in Finland.

You can work for the new employer for as long as your current seasonal work permit is valid. For more information, see: How to apply for the addition of a new employer.

Insurance I have been accepted as a student in a Finnish educational institution and I am about to apply for a residence permit. What kind of health insurance will I need? The extent of the insurance coverage required depends on the duration of your studies. An exchange student will, therefore, need a more comprehensive insurance than students studying for a degree. Please note, that if you are studying for a degree and some of the studies will be completed in another country, you will need a more comprehensive insurance. Where can I get the health insurance that I am required to have before applying for a residence permit for studies?

Each insurance and its terms and conditions are assessed individually when the residence permit application is examined. I have a European Health Insurance Card. Do I need to have insurance? You do not need to have insurance. By presenting the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), you can prove your right to necessary medical treatment in EU and EEA countries and in Switzerland. More information can be found under ‘Insurance’. I have a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Do I still need to have insurance? No, you don’t. A valid UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) is regarded as sufficient proof of insurance. Your health insurance card must be valid for the duration of your stay in Finland. I have a Kela card in Finland. Do I need to have insurance? As a student, you do not need to have insurance if you have a municipality of residence in Finland and a Kela card. If you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland but you have a Kela card, you can ask Kela to issue you with a certificate of entitlement to medical care. When you have a Kela card, you are covered under the National Health Insurance scheme, but it does not mean the same thing as being entitled to treatment in the public healthcare system in Finland. With the Kela card, you are entitled to receive reimbursement for the costs of medicines and fees of private doctors. If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, you are entitled to treatment in the public healthcare system.

Am I considered to have sufficient financial resources? You can have a sponsor, but you need to have a bank account in your own name for the money. To meet the income requirement, you also need to have the entire required amount of money in your bank account when you apply for the permit. Having a sponsorship agreement on receiving money into your account once a month from, for example, a relative, friend, or employer is not considered sufficient.

Do I need to have my bank statements translated? If the attachments are not in Finnish, Swedish or English, you should have them translated by an authorised translator and attach the translations to your application.

A family member who is moving to Finland together with you can apply for a residence permit at the same time with you or later. Why is the required level of income higher for spouses of students than for students? The required level of income is the same for spouses as for all people applying for a residence permit on the basis of family ties. It makes no difference what kind of residence permit their spouses have in Finland (for example a residence permit for studies or for an employed person). The income level requirement is based on how much money a person must have at his or her disposal in order to be able to finance his or her stay in Finland. The required income level is lower for students than for other applicants. It is based on the financial aid that Finnish students receive yearly. I am residing in Finland with a residence permit for studies, and I want my whole family to come to Finland. What is the income requirement for my entire family? The income requirement is the same for a student’s family as for all other family members of persons who have been granted a residence permit in Finland. For a spouse, the income requirement is 700 euros per month (8,400 euros per year), and for a first child, 500 euros per month (6,000 euros per year).

In addition, you may work in paid employment for a maximum of 30 hours per week. The number of working hours can be exceeded some weeks, as long as the average working hours are no more than 30 hours per week at the end of the year. Students can no longer work without restrictions during holidays or at the times when the educational institution offers no instruction. The right to work changed when the amendments to legislation on students and researchers entered into force on 15 April 2022. I have had a residence permit to look for work prior to the amendment that took effect on 15 April 2022.

https://www.migri.fi/faq-eu-citizens,"Frequently asked questions: EU citizens As an EU citizen, how do I enter Finland permanently and what kind of a permit will I need? As a Union citizen, you are free to enter Finland without a visa and reside in Finland for a maximum period of three months without registering your right of residence. In order to enter the country and reside there you must have a valid identity card or passport. As a Union citizen you must register your right of residence at the latest when three months have elapsed from your entry into the country. Decisions on registering Union citizens are made by the Finnish Immigration Service. You can find further instructions on the registration of your right of residence here. Registration takes place at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service and a written certificate of the registration will be issued to you (certificate of registration of the right of residence of a Union citizen). If you are a citizen of the Nordic countries, however, your registration will be handled by the local register office. In exceptional circumstances, Union citizens may be issued with a residence permit if they are unable to register on account of a lack of funds and if they were entitled to a residence permit without meeting the income requirement or if an exception could be made in a particular case concerning the income requirement. Leave your residence permit application to the Finnish Immigration Service. I am an EU citizen and have come to Finland to marry a Finn. I have resided in Finland for three months and would like to register. We have been co-habiting for more than three months now. How can we co-habit for the required two years if I cannot reside legally in Finland? I have no job. You may register on the basis of Union citizenship if you have sufficient means of livelihood, in other words, if you do not need to resort to income support and you have the necessary health insurance cover. Registration is also possible on the basis of financial activity (finding a job). Registration of Union citizens is decided by Finnish Immigration Service. You can find further instructions on the registration of your right of residence here. Do I have a right to gainful employment if I have a residence card of an EU citizen’s family member? If you have a residence card of an EU citizen’s family member, which has been issued by Finland, you may work freely in Finland. A separate work permit will not be required. However, you can not work in Finland with a residence card of an EU citizen's family member which has been issued by another EU member state. My spouse is a Finnish citizen. I am not an EU citizen or a comparable person. We lived together in France. Can I get a residence card when we move to Finland? You can get a residence card for a family member of an EU citizen. Your Finnish spouse has lived in another EU country and is returning to Finland. Your family was formed before he or she returned to Finland and you have lived with your spouse in another EU country. My spouse is a Finnish citizen. I am not an EU citizen or a comparable person. I got to know my spouse when he or she lived in Germany. We did not begin our relationship at this point. We got married after my spouse had moved back to Finland. Can I get a residence card when I move to join him or her in Finland? You cannot get a residence card for a family member of an EU citizen, because your family was only formed after your spouse returned to Finland after he or she had resided in another EU country. The relationship that led to your spouse becoming your family member did not begin when you were living in Germany. Instead of a residence card, you can apply for a residence permit as a spouse of a Finnish citizen. I am an EU citizen. If I already have been granted a personal identity code by the Local Register Office do I also have to apply for registration of the right of residence at the Finnish Immigration Service? Yes you do. If you stay in Finland for over three months without a break, you have to register your right of residence. It is not only enough to be granted a personal identity code but you also have to apply for a registration certificate of your right of residence in the EU at the Finnish Immigration Service. If you do not yet have a personal identity code the Finnish Immigration Service can grant you one in connection with the registration of your right of residence. When you apply for a registration certificate of your right of residence at the Finnish Immigration Service, you can also apply for a personal identity code with the same application form. What documents are needed to register an EU citizen’s right of residence? The documents needed for the registration are listed at the end of the application form. Are sufficient financial resources sufficient grounds for the registration of an EU citizen’s right of residence? Yes. You can register your right of residence as an EU citizen if you have sufficient funds to stay in Finland. Sufficient funds mean that you get by on your own funds and that you have no need to apply for social assistance in Finland. Will I be in trouble if I am not able to register within three months of arriving in Finland? You have to register your right of residence if you are staying in Finland without a break for over three months. Submit a registration application before your stay has lasted over three months. If you stay in Finland without a break for over three months and do not apply for registration you are committing a violation of the Aliens Act for which you can get a fine. It is enough that you submit an application within three months of your arrival in Finland. It does not matter whether the decision is made within three months. How do you register an EU citizen’s child who was born in Finland? You apply for a registration certificate for the child on the basis of family ties. To do this you have to fill in a separate EU_REK form for the child. At least one of the guardians has to be present when submitting the paper application or when proving the child’s identity after submitting the application in the e-service. If both of the guardians are not personally present, you have to get a written consent to the application from the other guardian. The child has to have an own valid passport or identity card. Does the employer have to take care of the registration of an EU citizen? An employer cannot take care of the registration on the behalf of an EU citizen. The EU citizen himself or herself has to apply for the registration. Can I change the grounds for the registration of an EU citizen’s right of residence afterwards? You cannot change the registration ground for another ground afterwards. Once a registration has been made it will be valid until further notice if it is not cancelled with a separate decision. When you have stayed in Finland without a break for five years you can apply for a certificate proving you have a permanent right of residence. How can an EU citizen extend the validity of the registration? The registration is always valid until further notice. So you do not have to extend the validity of the registration. After staying in Finland without a break for five years you can apply for a certificate proving you have a permanent right of residence. How do you cancel a registration when an EU citizen leaves Finland after his or her employment ends? If an EU citizen permanently moves away from Finland, he or she has to inform the Finnish Immigration Service of that. At the same time he or she has to submit to the Finnish Immigration Service a signed written request to cancel his or her registration. After the notification, the Finnish Immigration Service will make a separate decision on cancelling the registration. A person leaving Finland should also inform the Local Register Office that he or she is moving as the Local Register Office will update the information in the Population Information System. How should an employee of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) register his or her residence? The employees of ECHA are exempt of the formalities related to the registration. An employee of the Agency, his or her spouse or a family member dependent on him or her who is an EU citizen does not have to register his or her right of residence. The employees of ECHA and their abovementioned family members who are EU citizens can register their right of residence in the normal way, if desired, but they are not obliged to do so. If the family member of the Agency’s employee is not an EU citizen or a comparable person the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland can grant him or her a temporary residence permit by virtue of Section 69 of the Aliens Act. I am an EU citizen and studying in Finland for six months. If I visit Estonia twice during the six months, do I need to register my right of residence in Finland? You do not need to do so if you do not stay in Finland without a break for over three months. If, for example, you arrive in Finland in January and travel outside Finland in March and May, you do not need to register your residence. Keep the receipt or tickets of your journey, in case you need to prove later that you travelled abroad.",EU citizens

Tracing is carried out to re-establish the connection between a minor who is seeking asylum and his or her parent or guardian who is residing outside Finland. The information gathered through tracing is important for decision-making and can later help reunite the family. Tracing is always carried out taking into account the best interest of the child. It is usually in the best interest of the child to know where his or her parents or guardians are. According to the Aliens Act, measures must be taken to trace the parents or some other persons responsible for the actual custody of an unaccompanied minor whenever possible. What is meant by age determination and why is this necessary for an asylum seeker? Age assessment is an important part of establishing an asylum seeker’s identity. Some statutory rights and obligations of asylum seekers depend on their age. For example, a child under the age of 18 applying for international protection who does not have a guardian is safeguarded through special arrangements during the asylum process and at the reception centre for asylum seekers.

The age assessment can be performed if you, your guardian or your other legal representative gives a written consent. If you refuse the age assessment without an acceptable reason, you will be treated as an adult. However, this alone is not a reason for us to reject your asylum application.

https://www.migri.fi/en/interviewing-children,"Frequently asked questions: Interviewing children Why are children interviewed during the asylum process? Children have the right to be heard in decisions that affect them. It is in the best interests of a child that his or her opinion is taken into account when such decisions are made. Another reason for interviewing children who apply for asylum together with their family is that the children may also have their own grounds for asylum. Under the Aliens Act, the Finnish Immigration Service has an obligation to hear all children over the age of 12 before making a decision that affects them. Even a younger child may be heard if the child is sufficiently mature to have his or her views taken into account. In addition, the agency has a principle of hearing all unaccompanied minor asylum seekers regardless of age. What is the interview like? Interviews with children consist of free narrative, meaning that the child can give their own account. In asylum matters, interview is the most important method to find out what a person has to say about their situation. Children are interviewed in the presence of their parents, and the parents can participate in the discussion. In addition to the child and his or her parents, there is also an interpreter and a Finnish Immigration Service employee present at the interview. The Finnish Immigration Service uses trained employees who are specialised in interviewing children. Usually, the interview takes between one and two hours. To make the child feel safe, part of the interview time is used to get to know each other. What is meant by a child’s ‘best interests’ in the asylum process? The ‘best interests’ of a child is a principle of law that must always be followed when the Finnish Immigration Service makes decisions affecting children. The best interests of a child are assessed individually on a case-by-case basis. When a decision is made, the overall situation of the child is taken into account. This includes the child’s personal background, situation and needs. When a best interests assessment is made, several viewpoints are taken into account. The primary criterion is security. A child’s grounds for international protection may be stronger than an adult’s. Children may also have their own grounds for asylum independently of their parents. There are also forms of persecution that only affect children. All this, together with the security situation in the child’s home region, is taken into account in asylum decisions. When a child’s best interests are assessed, we take into account the child’s family ties and other close relationships as well as the child’s religious, linguistic and cultural background. Also any individual needs concerning, for instance, the child’s development or health are taken into account. What does the law say about interviewing children? In Finland, provisions on interviewing minors are laid down in the Aliens Act (see section 6 of the Aliens Act). The Finnish Immigration Service has been conducting separate interviews with all co-applicants who have turned 12, and the agency will keep doing so even in the future. That is a statutory duty. The agency has also interviewed younger co-applicants if it has been deemed necessary. Interviewing minors is and has been an important way of assessing what would be in a child’s best interests in his or her situation. Children are always interviewed in accordance with their age and maturity. This is a statutory duty laid down in the Aliens Act. Why do you interview children whose parents have converted to Christianity? If a child is a member of a religious community, it can affect the child's risk of facing persecution in his or her home country. A person’s religion may constitute grounds for asylum. Conversion to Christianity may affect a child's daily life in Finland even when he or she is young. The child may, for instance, have participated in church activities. Naturally, children may be in risk of facing persecution because of other reasons as well. Sometimes, however, these events may have affected the parents in their home country or a long time ago. In such cases, it may not be necessary to interview the children. What is a child able to tell about his or her situation? Interviewing a child is necessary if the matter in question affects the child and if the child can be assumed to have information about the matter. In the hearing, the child can be asked for instance about what it means to him or her to be a member of a Christian congregation and what the child’s own opinion about this is. The purpose of asking such questions is to gather additional information about how the child is in risk of persecution. However, the aim is not to use the child's statement against the family. A child’s statement alone cannot determine whether the family is granted asylum or not. Children are always interviewed in accordance with their age and maturity. What if children say something that contradicts their parents’ statement? A child’s statement cannot be the only factor that determines the outcome of a family’s asylum application. If something exceptional comes up, the agency may later ask the parents about it separately. The purpose of interviewing children is not to use their statements against the family. On the contrary, the aim of the hearing is to see whether the children have anything to add to their parents’ statements. Children can even have their own grounds for international protection that have not come up before.",Interviewing children

What changed on 1 October 2024 when the amendments to the Citizenship Act entered into force? Period of residence The period of residence required for becoming a Finnish citizen was extended from 5 years to 8 years. In some cases, the required period of residence is shorter than 8 years. Your required period of residence is 5 years if:you have the required language skillsyou are the spouse of a Finnish citizen you are stateless. For co-applicants aged 15 to 17, the required period of residence is 5 years. A co-applicant is a child whom you have custody of and for whom you apply for Finnish citizenship at the same time as you apply for citizenship for yourself.
Your required period of residence is 2 years if:you are a Nordic citizen oryou are the spouse of a Finnish diplomat. Further amendments were made to the period of residence required of applicants who have been granted international protection. If you have been granted international protection, your required period of residence is 8 years. In addition, the way the period of residence is calculated has changed for applicants who have been granted international protection. The counting no longer begins from the day when you submitted your asylum application. Instead, the period of residence is counted from the start date of your first continuous residence permit (an A permit). Processing time of applications Citizenship decisions for persons who have been granted international protection or who are stateless must be made within one year of the submission of the citizenship application.
Residence abroad The amendments to the Citizenship Act changed the duration of residence abroad that can be included in the period of residence. During the required period of residence, you can reside outside Finland for 365 days. During one year immediately before the citizenship decision, you can reside abroad for a maximum of 90 days. 5. I’m applying for Finnish citizenship by declaration. Will the reform of the Citizenship Act affect those who apply by declaration? No, those who can apply by declaration are not affected. The reform of the Citizenship Act only affects those who seek to acquire Finnish citizenship on application. 6. I applied for Finnish citizenship before 1 October 2024 but I added my 15-year-old child as my co-applicant after 1 October. How will this affect my child’s application? In this case, we will consider your child’s application to have become pending at the same time as your own application. The previous version of the Citizenship Act will be applied to your child’s application, too. 7. I sent my application on Enter Finland before 1 October 2024 but I proved my identity at a service point after 1 October 2024. Which version of the Citizenship Act will you follow? Your application will be decided in accordance with the old version of the Act because you submitted your application before 1 October 2024. Income and livelihood8. When I apply for citizenship, what kind of account of my livelihood do I need to provide? When you apply for citizenship, you must provide a reliable account of your livelihood in your application. You need to prove how you have earned your income over the past 5 years. If the required period of residence is shorter than that, provide documents on your income covering the shorter period. Period of residence9. Next year, I will have lived in Finland for the period of residence required for citizenship. Can I apply for citizenship already now? Submit the application when you meet all the requirements and have the required attachments. The decision may be negative if you do not meet the requirements or if a mandatory attachment is missing. 10. How does time spent abroad affect the period of residence? In total, you can spend 365 days outside Finland during the required period of residence. Up to 90 of these days can be from the one-year period preceding the citizenship decision. If you spend more time abroad, the exceeding days will not be counted towards your period of residence. If you exceed the maximum number of days abroad, this will postpone the day when you will meet the period of residence requirement. For example: If your required period of residence is 5 years and you get a decision on 1 July 2025, we will count the days you have spent abroad between 1 July 2020 and 1 July 2025. If you have been abroad for a maximum of 365 days, the days abroad will be accepted as part of your period of residence. During one year immediately before the decision, which in this example would be 1 July 2024–1 July 2025, a maximum of 90 days abroad are accepted as part of your period of residence. The day when you leave Finland and the day when you return to Finland will be counted towards your period of residence. 11. Will the trips abroad that I have made after submitting the application be counted as residence outside Finland? Yes. All trips abroad during the required period of residence until the day when you receive a decision on your application will be counted as time abroad. 12. Is the reason why I have spent time abroad of any relevance when you count the period of residence?
No, the reason why you have spent time abroad is not relevant. 13. I have stayed outside Finland for more than 90 days during the past year. How will this affect my application? When we calculate your period of residence, a maximum of 90 days spent abroad during one year immediately before the citizenship decision are accepted. Extra days abroad will not be counted towards your period of residence. If you exceed the maximum number of days abroad, this will postpone the day when you meet the period of residence requirement. 14. Is the day when I leave Finland counted as a day abroad? The day when you leave Finland and the day when you return to Finland will be counted towards your period of residence, not as a day abroad. For example: If you have been travelling from 1 October to 31 October, this will amount to 29 days abroad. 15. I used to be married to a Finn. Will my required period of residence be shorter than usual because of this? No. Your required period of residence is shorter only if your current spouse is a Finnish citizen. Read more about the required period of residence. 16. I have been granted asylum in Finland. Is my required period of residence shorter than usual? No, your required period of residence is 8 years. Your period of residence is calculated from the date when you received your first continuous residence permit (an A permit). In some cases, a shorter period of residence is enough. See the page Period of residence for more information. 17. I have lived in Finland for 4 years and I have the required language skills. Can I be granted Finnish citizenship? No, not yet. If you have the required language skills, you must have lived in Finland for 5 years. 18. I applied for an extended permit too late. How will this affect my period of residence? The time without a valid residence permit will not be counted as part of your period of residence. Applications for an extended permit must be submitted before the old residence permit expires. The time you reside in Finland without a residence permit is illegal residence. 19. Is the reason why I have spent time abroad, outside Finland, of any relevance to the interruption of continuous residence? The reason why you have lived abroad is not relevant, except when there is a well-founded personal reason. Your period of residence will interrupt if, for instance, your Finnish employer has sent you abroad on assignment and the period of absence from Finland is too long. Read more about calculating the period of residence and travelling abroad. 20. Next year, I will have lived in Finland for the period of residence required for citizenship. I am planning to take the YKI test (the National Certificate of Language Proficiency test) next year. Can I apply for citizenship already now? It is not advisable to submit a citizenship application before you meet the requirements and have obtained all the required attachments. You must attach a certificate of your language proficiency to your application to prove that you meet the language skills requirement. If you submit a citizenship application but do not meet the requirements or an obligatory attachment is missing, it will delay the processing of the application and may result in a negative decision. Language skills21. I have lived in Finland for four years and want to apply for Finnish citizenship. How do I prove my language skills? If you have attained the language skills required for citizenship, you can apply for Finnish citizenship once you have lived in Finland for 4 years without interruption.
Read more about which certificates are accepted as proof of sufficient language skills. 22. I have lived in Finland for 10 years. Must I prove my language skills when I apply for Finnish citizenship? Yes, proof of language skills is always required, no matter how long the applicant has resided in Finland before applying for citizenship. In some cases, it is possible to derogate from the language skills requirement. 23. Which examination do I need to complete, the National Certificate of Lan-guage Proficiency (YKI) or the Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate? You can use either examination to prove the required language skills. You can choose yourself which one to take. Read more on the page Language skills. Read more about how to prove your language skills. 24. Is the passing of a maturity test as part of a higher education degree considered sufficient demonstration of language skills? Yes, it is sufficient if you took the maturity test in Finnish or Swedish. 25. Can I demonstrate my language proficiency using a type of language certificate that is not mentioned on the website of the Finnish Immigration Service? No. Language proficiency can only be demonstrated with one of the certificates listed on our website. 26. How can a 15-year-old who has not yet completed comprehensive education demonstrate his or her language skills? In that case, the applicant can attach to the application the most recent school report that shows the grade awarded in the Finnish or Swedish language. 27. I have completed compulsory basic education and/or upper secondary education in Sweden. Can a certificate of Swedish basic education or upper secondary education be used to demonstrate that I meet the language skills requirement? No, it cannot. You can demonstrate that you meet the language skills requirement by submitting a Finnish comprehensive school or upper secondary school leaving certificate showing that you have passed the examination in Finnish or Swedish as your native language or as a second language. If you have completed basic education or upper secondary education in Sweden, we would advise you to obtain the National Certificate of Language Proficiency (YKI) or the Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate, for example. Read more about how to prove your language skills. 28. I am an adult and cannot read or write in any language. What documents do I need to provide? Ask a teacher who has taught you in Finland to issue a certificate confirming that you were unable to read and write when you arrived in Finland. In addition, you need to submit a certificate that states the level of your speaking and comprehension skills in the Finnish or Swedish language (on the scale of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) or a certificate showing that you have regularly participated in studies in the Finnish or Swedish language. Read more about requesting an exception to the language skills requirement. 29. I would like to request an exception to the language skills requirement because of my illness. What documents do I need to provide? Ask a doctor who is treating you to issue a certificate in which the doctor states whether your illness or disability is such that it permanently prevents you from acquiring the required language skills. The doctor’s certificate must describe how your illness or disability prevents you from learning a language and how your condition has been treated. The Finnish Immigration Service does not have a list of doctors to recommend. Please contact the doctor who is treating you to ask for a certificate. In addition to a doctor’s certificate, submit certificates of all language courses you have taken in Finland. Release from Finnish citizenship30. If I am released from Finnish citizenship, how can I later regain it? As a former Finnish citizen, you can apply for Finnish citizenship by submitting a citizenship declaration. Read more about citizenship declarations. However, you cannot regain Finnish citizenship by declaration if you lost it because you gave false information in your earlier citizenship application and received your citizenship on wrongful grounds. You also cannot regain Finnish citizenship by declaration if you lost it because of the annulment of paternity. 31. Will I lose my Finnish citizenship, if I apply for and acquire citizenship of another state? No, you will not lose your Finnish citizenship in that case. Finnish legislation allows multiple citizenship (dual citizenship). Please note that if you hold another citizenship in addition to your Finnish citizenship, you will not necessarily retain your Finnish citizenship automatically when your turn 22. Read more about retaining Finnish citizenship at the age of 22. Former Finnish citizen32. Do the attachments to a citizenship declaration need to be original or certified copies of the original? Documents attached to your citizenship declaration must be original documents when you submit your application at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service in Finland or a Finnish mission abroad. When your application is being processed, you must also present original documents, if requested, to the Finnish Immigration Service. Documents issued by foreign authorities must be legalised. For further information about legalisation, see the website of the Digital and Population Data Services Agency (dvv. fi). 33. Do foreign-language attachments to citizenship applications and declarations need to be translated into Finnish, Swedish or English? Do the translations need to be official? Yes, translations are required if the documents have been issued in a language other than Finnish, Swedish or English. The translation must be made by an authorised translator. You can search for authorised translators on the website of the Finnish National Agency for Education (oph. fi). 34. I am a former Finnish citizen. How can I regain my lost Finnish citizenship? As a former Finnish citizen, you can apply for Finnish citizenship by submitting a citizenship declaration. Read more about citizenship declarations. 35. If I lost my Finnish citizenship when I turned 22, how can I get my citizenship back? If you are a former Finnish citizen, you can submit a citizenship declaration in order to regain your citizenship. Read more about citizenship declarations. Children36. If a child was born before 1 June 2003 to a father who is a Finnish citizen, is the child Finnish citizen as well? In this case, the child obtained Finnish citizenship at birth if the child’s father was a Finnish citizen when the child was born and was married to the child’s mother when the child was born. If the child's parents were not married when the child was born but got married before 1 June 2003, the child obtained Finnish citizenship automatically when the parents got married. This requires that the paternity was confirmed. In contrast, if the parents got married after the child’s birth and after 1 June 2003, the child did not obtain Finnish citizenship when the parents got married. Further, the child did not obtain Finnish citizenship when the parents got married in the following cases:If the parents were not the child’s guardians when they got married. If the child had reached the age of 18. If the child got married before the parents got married. Read more about children and Finnish citizenship. 37. Me and my spouse have applied for Finnish citizenship. A child was born to us after we had submitted our applications. How do I apply for citizenship for the child? Do we need to submit a new application? In this case, you do not need to submit a new application. You can add the child as a co-applicant to your own application by filling in the supplement form KAN_LIITELOMAKE for the child. If you and your spouse applied for citizenship with the online service Enter Finland, you can fill in the child’s supplement form and upload it on Enter Finland. Book then an appointment for a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service. Bring the child with you to the service point. If you and your spouse applied for citizenship with a paper form, fill in the child’s supplement form and book an appointment for a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service. Bring the child with you to the service point when you submit the supplement form. 38. Me and my spouse have applied for Finnish citizenship. A child was born to us after we had submitted the applications. Do we need to apply for a residence permit for our newborn child? A residence permit application must be submitted for the child within 3 months of the child being born. This means that if you do not get a decision on your citizenship applications soon after the birth, you will need to apply for a residence permit for the child. After decision39. Why have I not received a decision on my citizenship application? There are currently backlogs in the processing of citizenship applications. In particular, the backlogs concern applications where we have to ask for additional information or documents in order to process them. The processing time is shortest for applications where the customer has arrived in Finland with a permit obtained in advance, the customer has a national passport and he or she meets the general requirements for naturalisation. We will contact you if additional information is needed for your application. 40. I lost my previous citizenship when acquiring Finnish citizenship. Is it possible to regain it? The Finnish Nationality Act allows multiple citizenship. You should consult the authorities of the country in question regarding the possibility of regaining citizenship. The easiest way to do so is to contact the embassy of the state in question. You will find embassies' contact information from website of the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (um. fi). 41. What should I do with my residence permit card once I have been granted Finnish citizenship? Send your residence permit card to the Finnish Immigration Service by post (PL 10, 00086 Maahanmuuttovirasto). The Finnish Immigration Service will annul your card, and the card is no longer valid. 42. How do I get a Finnish passport once I have been granted Finnish citizenship? Finnish passports are issued by the police. If you hold a Finnish refugee travel document or an alien’s passport issued by Finland, you must return your refugee travel document or alien’s passport to the police before you can obtain a Finnish passport. See the website www. poliisi. fi for further information, contact details, and instructions on how to apply for a passport. 43. I applied for Finnish citizenship by declaration. Which date will be entered in the Finnish Population Information System as the date of acquisition of Finnish citizenship? This depends on when you have met the requirements for acquiring Finnish citizenship. If you met the requirements when your declaration became pending, that date will be registered in the Population Information System as the date when you acquired Finnish citizenship. If you did not yet meet all the requirements when you submitted the declaration, the date when you acquired Finnish citizenship will be the date on which the requirements were met. For example, if you submit a citizenship declaration on 1 January 2023 and meet all the requirements already then, 1 January 2023 will be registered in the Population Information System as the date when you acquired Finnish citizenship.",Finnish citizenship

https://www.migri.fi/emn/en,"European Migration Network The Finnish national contact point for the European Migration Network (EMN) is located in the Finnish Immigration Service. Similar national contact points exist in all EU countries and Norway which is also a network member. The Network is chaired by the European Commission.
The EMN’s objective is to support policy-making in the EU by providing up-to-date, objective, reliable and comparable information on migration and asylum. In addition to politicians and government officials, the EMN also provides information to the general public.
The Finnish EMN national contact point website is at www. emn. fi. The website contains research reports conducted by the EMN, a list of all the ad hoc queries on migration issues made by the EU Members States through the network, and information on current events. Reports and studies The EMN’s main products are annual reports on the development of immigration policy in the EU Member States and bodies, and various thematic studies on topical migration issues. The topics of thematic studies are selected among proposals made by national EMN contact points and the European Commission. For all reports and studies, each contact point first produces a national report. The Commission then prepares a synthesis of the national reports. In addition to reviews, studies and reports, the contact points may send each other ad hoc queries on topics related to immigration. The answers are summarised in an information package.
The EMN’s annual reports, reviews and studies are publicly available on its website at ec. europa. eu/emn. Reports, reviews and studies may also be published in print. National network The EMN national contact points have also established national expert networks around them. You can register your membership in the National Network in Finland on our national website. We welcome both organisations and individual representatives of government bodies, research forums, NGOs and other interested parties. The National Network members can suggest and get heard in the selection of EMN research topics. They can also get involved in the production of studies and national-level responses to ad hoc queries. They get opportunities for networking both on national and international level. In annual national seminars, the National Network members focus on some current migration issue, presenting the latest EMN research and relevant national studies and operations on that theme. Background The EMN began as a pilot project in 2003. In May 2008, the network was granted permanent status by a decision of the Council of the European Union. Initially, the Finnish national contact point operated at Statistics Finland, but as the scope of the operations expanded from statistics to other research, the contact point was transferred to the Finnish Immigration Service in 2008. The contact point is partially funded by the EU. More informationwww. emn. fi",EMN

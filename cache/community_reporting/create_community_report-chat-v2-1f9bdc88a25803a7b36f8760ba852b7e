It is a concept that acknowledges and confirms maternity when parents are married, and it signifies a commitment between the couple to contribute to shared finances and subsistence. Civil marriages are conducted at the Digital and Population Data Services Agency and require an appointment for examination of potential impediments under Finnish law. Marriage is not a requirement for the couple living in Finland or for Finnish citizenship by notification, but it may affect the residence permit in Finland. Marriage can be dissolved by filing for divorce, and if a divorce application has been filed, the marriage is considered to have ended. Marriage-related services are offered at family counselling centres, and marriages that have ended are subject to investigation or examination of potential impediments.\",12\r\n1632,DISTRICT COURT,\" The District Court serves as a crucial judicial entity, primarily functioning as the venue where divorce applications are filed. In cases where parents fail to reach an agreement on child maintenance support, it also acts as the court where the matter will be resolved. Additionally, the District Court is tasked with enforcing decisions made within its jurisdiction. Notably, civil marriages are also performed in this court. Furthermore, it ensures that proper notification about divorce applications is delivered to the other spouse.\",5\r\n1993,CIVIL MARRIAGE,,2\r\n707,FAMILY COUNSELLING CENTRE,\" The Family Counselling Centre is an organization that offers assistance to individuals and families experiencing various challenges within their marriages, relationships, and family dynamics.

They can accompany their minor child to a youth station for help, sign library card applications for individuals under 15 years of age, and apply for daily allowances on behalf of their child if necessary.\n\nIn case of an ill child, the parents will be informed by the school. They are also involved in activities involving their children and can represent them when needed. In the context of birth, they are present during the delivery. If the child is a minor residing in Finland, their parents or carers can be granted a residence permit.

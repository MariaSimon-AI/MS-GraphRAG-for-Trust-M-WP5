They are subject to Finnish labor law, entitled to regular health checks through occupational health care, and covered by the law regarding free time and rest periods. Employees work under the terms of an employment contract and have the right to a record of their working hours. They follow rules in Finnish working life, safety protocols, and report hazards to their supervisor. In case of termination or ending of the employment relationship, employees are entitled to receive a certificate of employment from their employer. Employees may also cancel the contract due to non-fulfillment of obligations or rule violations by the employer. They have the right to express their views in Finnish workplaces regardless of age and position. Employees are affected by the employer's decisions regarding tasks, career advancement, or termination of employment. They may be offered work by the employer and are familiarized with their new tasks and workplace safety instructions upon hiring. During the employment relationship, employees have two days off per week. Lastly, employees who are not self-employed or driving a company car may be exempt from car tax in Finland for a temporary and short period.\",56\r\n1123,COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT,\" The Collective Agreement is a legally binding document, primarily established between an employer and a trade union or unions representing the employees. This agreement regulates wages, hours, and other conditions of employment for a specific group of workers within a particular industry or company. In the context of Finland, this agreement may also include provisions for holiday bonuses. The Collective Agreement serves as a comprehensive outline of the terms and conditions of employment for its members, encompassing working hours provisions as well as details regarding benefits for the workers.\",5\r\n727,WORKING HOURS,\" The concept known as Working Hours refers to the regular business hours during which most jobs operate, as well as the number of hours an employee works per day or week. This term is covered by the collective agreements and is also defined according to Finnish law. It represents the hours an employee is expected to work under their employer's disposal.\",5\r\n801,OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH AUTHORITIES,\" The Occupational Safety and Health Authorities serve as the primary entity responsible for addressing matters related to workplace safety, health issues, and handling testimonials of service. They function as a point of contact for reporting any inappropriate behavior that may occur within these workplaces.\",5\r\n1133,HOLIDAYS,\" Holidays are longer periods of time off from work, typically taken by individuals for rest, relaxation, or celebration. These events are recognized as special occasions and are covered under collective agreements, including those in Finland. As such, they are officially granted to employees, providing them with a break from their regular work duties.\",2\r\n201,TESTIMONIAL OF SERVICE,\" The Testimonial of Service serves as a written evaluation or recommendation offered by an employer to an employee during their departure from the company. This document also functions as a verification of the service provided, which can be utilized for calculating pension benefits. In essence, it is a textual account that discusses the service rendered by the employee during their tenure with the organization.\",4\r\n433,EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS ACT,\" The Employment Contracts Act is a legal statute that outlines the rules governing the termination of employment relationships.

This individual plays a crucial role in maintaining the workflow and productivity of the team. One of their significant responsibilities includes informing employees about any medical certificate requirements that may be necessary.\n\nIn addition to these duties, the Supervisor is also accountable for reporting absences, whether due to illness or accidents, to the appropriate authorities. They are also responsible for monitoring and checking the length of breaks taken by employees.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in some instances, the Supervisor may themselves become the subject of a report, as was indicated in one description regarding inappropriate behavior. This suggests that while they play a vital role in maintaining order and ensuring compliance with regulations, they are not exempt from the organization's rules and expectations.\",3\r\n4460,A1 CERTIFICATE,Proof of being insured in the country of residence to avoid paying health insurance in Finland,1\r\n2375,AMMATTILIITTO,\"Trade union in Finland that employees can join for information, benefits, and advice on employment issues\",1\r\n3017,CAREER ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES,Opportunities for growth and advancement within an organization or workplace.,1\r\n2191,CERTIFICATE OF SALARY PAYMENT,A document that proves salary payment to an employee,1\r\n1805,DAYS OFF,Periods of time off work granted to employees,1\r\n2663,DISMISSALS,Termination of employment in Finland,1\r\n91,PART-TIME WORK,\" The PART-TIME WORK refers to a type of employment arrangement where an individual works for fewer hours per week compared to a full-time employee.

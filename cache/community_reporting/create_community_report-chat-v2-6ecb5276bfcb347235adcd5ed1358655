This event, which involves the granting of a further extension for residency, is the primary focus under discussion.\",6\r\n4819,GROUNDS,\" The GROUNDS serve as the primary basis for obtaining the initial permit and also play a significant role in determining their selection for training. This implies that the grounds' characteristics, conditions, or features are crucial factors to consider when making decisions regarding their use for training purposes.\",3\r\n5285,IMMIGRATION SERVICE,\" The Immigration Service is an organization that plays a crucial role in the processing of asylum applications, while also extending residence permits. This implies that it handles both initial applications and subsequent extensions for those granted residency within its jurisdiction.\",2\r\n5286,EXTENSION PERIOD,,1\r\n5287,REASON FOR EXTENSION,,1\r\n521,ELECTRONIC APPLICATION FEE,\" The Electronic Application Fee, in question, varies depending on the specific permit application. For the initial permit application submitted electronically, the fee ranges from 380€ to 490€. If an extended permit is being applied for electronically, the fee is 170€. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the provided data as another source states the fee for submitting an electronic application is 140 €. To provide a coherent summary, it's best to consider the range of fees mentioned: the Electronic Application Fee for permit applications can cost between 140€ and 490€, depending on the type and duration of the permit being applied for.\",2\r\n1349,FIRST PERMIT,\" The first permit, referred to as \"\"FIRST PERMIT,\"\" carries different costs depending on the method of application. If applied electronically, the cost is set at 380€. However, if submitted in paper format, the fee increases to 480€. Despite an initial contradictory statement suggesting a cost of 520€ for the first permit, this information appears to be incorrect as it conflicts with the majority of the provided data.

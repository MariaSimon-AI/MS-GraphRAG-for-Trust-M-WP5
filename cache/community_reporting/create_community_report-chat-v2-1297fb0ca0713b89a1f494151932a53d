It serves as the language of instruction at various educational institutions, including Kajaani University of Applied Sciences and general upper secondary schools across the country. In Kauniainen, Finnish is used for early childhood education, pre-primary education, and city integration services.\n\nIn Finland, Finnish is the language most newspapers are published, performances in Helsinki's theatres are conducted, and films are subtitled. It is also the language of public administration, used for emergency calls, and for feedback, initiatives, questions, and comments on various websites such as the City of Kauniainen's.\n\nFor immigrants, Finnish is taught as a second language in basic education, vocational studies at Varia, and adult education centers. It can also be studied as a foreign language in preparatory education and S2 classes for children whose native language is not Finnish. The National Certificate of Language Proficiency can be obtained in Espoo, and the language proficiency exam can be taken in Turku.\n\nThe Tuntihinta app, business briefings, and language courses are available in Finnish. For non-native speakers, support may be provided for learning Finnish if it is not their native language. The child's native language will also determine whether they study Finnish as a foreign language or receive support in learning it.\n\nFinnish is used for early childhood education in Espoo's day-care centres and family providers, and for subtitling films in Finland. It is also the language of instruction at the University of Tampere Self Access Centre and the counselling sessions provided by Familia Club's Duo Project.\n\nFor Finnish citizenship application, one must prove proficiency in Finnish. The child may not have Finnish as their native language if they are in Finland. Finnish is also used for early childhood education in Vaasa's institutions and most general upper secondary schools in Finland.\n\nIn addition to English, Kajaani International Info provides services in Finnish, and International House Turku offers its services in Finnish. The online application for KAN_2 is available in Finnish, as well as one of the languages provided by Väestöliitto's work career mentoring program in Finland.\n\nIn\",22\r\n67,SWEDISH,\" Swedish, one of the two official languages in Finland, is widely used and spoken in various contexts. It is commonly used for education in Sweden and some parts of Finland, including Espoo, Vaasa, and Kauniainen. In Kauniainen specifically, approximately 32% of the residents speak Swedish. The language is also used for early childhood education, pre-primary education, and in some general upper secondary schools in these regions.\n\nIn Sweden, Swedish is the native language and is spoken during emergency calls. It is also used for official communication and services, public administration purposes, and for subtitling films alongside Finnish in Finland. The National Certificate of Language Proficiency can be obtained in Espoo, and the language proficiency exam can be taken in Turku.\n\nSwedish is also used for feedback, initiatives, questions, and comments on the City of Kauniainen's website. It is one of the languages in which some Addiction Link services are available. The language can be improved through TUVA education.\n\nIn Finland's localities, some newspapers are published in Swedish. In Helsinki libraries, it is used in some books and is spoken by Nollalina's staff. It is a language that children can study as a foreign language in S2 classes if their native language is not Swedish. The municipality provides preparatory education in Swedish.\n\nIn the event of applying for Finnish citizenship, proficiency in Swedish can be used to prove proficiency. Swedish is spoken by a minority of Finns and is one of the languages that can be learned in a language course in Finland. It can also be studied as part of the labour market training.\n\nIn summary, Swedish is an important language with significant presence and usage across Sweden and parts of Finland, serving various purposes from education to official communication and services.\",17\r\n1496,NATIONAL CERTIFICATE OF LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY,\" The National Certificate of Language Proficiency (NCLP) is an assessment tool used to evaluate one's language proficiency in either Finnish or Swedish. This certificate serves as proof of linguistic ability, particularly relevant for public administration purposes. It is mandatory for Finnish citizenship application processes.\n\nThe NCLP is associated with events related to language proficiency certification, such as those held in Vaasa, Finland, and Turku, where the National Board of Education offers this certificate for both Finnish and Swedish languages.\",3\r\n1683,FAMILY DAY-CARE PROVIDERS,\" The Family Day-Care Providers are entities that offer early childhood education services.

However, it is important to note that family members of a person with a residence permit for seasonal work in Finland cannot be granted a residence permit based on family ties due to Finnish immigration regulations. In exceptional cases, such as the organization of burial for deceased relatives before the burial permit is issued, there may be exceptions to this rule.\",2\r\n2031,DECEASED PERSON,\" The DECEASED PERSON is an individual who requires a burial permit in order to be laid to rest. Despite this, there appears to be a discrepancy in the provided descriptions, as the DECEASED PERSON is also identified as the owner of the estate being inventoried. To resolve this contradiction, it can be inferred that the ownership of the estate refers to any assets or properties belonging to the deceased person prior to their demise, and not to the physical body itself. Therefore, the DECEASED PERSON is an individual who requires a burial permit to be buried, and whose estate is being inventoried for asset distribution purposes.\",2\r\n2029,BURIAL PERMIT,Document needed for a deceased person to be buried,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n582,RESIDENCE PERMIT,FAMILY MEMBERS,Partners in such a relationship are not considered family members for the purpose of residence permits,54\r\n3078,ESTATE INVENTORY,DECEASED PERSON,The estate inventory is of the deceased person's property and debts,5\r\n3478,BURIAL PERMIT,DECEASED PERSON,A deceased person needs a burial permit to be buried,4\r\n3479,BURIAL PERMIT,FAMILY MEMBERS,Family members can start to organize the burial before the burial permit is issued,4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report should include the following sections:\r\n\r\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.

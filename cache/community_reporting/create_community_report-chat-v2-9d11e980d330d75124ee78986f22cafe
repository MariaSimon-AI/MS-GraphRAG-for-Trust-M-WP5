They aid in job search activities, offer information on available job vacancies, and supply details about relevant training programs and services designed for the unemployed. Contrary to some misconceptions, these services do not primarily focus on providing information about travel plans within Finland. Instead, their primary goal is to facilitate employment opportunities and support for those in need.\",4\r\n567,ADDRESS,\" The ADDRESS, as a type of location, serves multiple purposes. It primarily functions as a place where personal data can be stored, such as in the case of an applicant's residential address. In certain contexts, it also provides essential information for travel within Finland or abroad. Notably, in Finland, it is possible to register a temporary address using one's personal identity code. Additionally, addresses are required for contractual purposes. It is worth noting that when provided by an individual, their address will be entered into the Finnish Population Information System by the Digital and Population Data Services Agency.\",6\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n370,FINLAND,EMPLOYMENT SERVICES,\" In Finland, the provision of employment services is a responsibility primarily undertaken by municipalities.

This grade level is significant as it is recommended that parents accompany their child during dental examinations due to the child's age and potential apprehension. Additionally, children in 1st Grade may be eligible for partial care allowance, indicating financial support provided by certain systems to help cover their living expenses.\",3\r\n360,PARENTS,\" The term \"\"PARENTS\"\" refers to adults who are primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of a child. They play an essential role in pre-primary education, making decisions regarding their child's religious affiliation, and often participate in various activities together. These parents may be involved in therapy sessions for young people, either individually or collectively as part of an organization.\n\nIn some cases, these parents may be divorced or have ended a common-law relationship. They might also be unmarried and have not acknowledged paternity or maternity of their child. Some parents may face challenges in agreeing on child maintenance support.\n\nParents who reside in Oulu and have children eligible for family clubs organized by the city will receive peer support from other parents. The last name given to a child is often derived from the parents.\",9\r\n1282,ADVISORY SERVICES,\" The ADVISORY SERVICES, specifically those of a municipality, are entities that offer assistance to parents. These services are designed to provide additional information to the public, particularly in matters related to their role as parents.\",2\r\n1610,TEACHERS,\" Teachers are individuals who lead and guide various activities within educational institutions. They have the autonomy to plan their own teaching methods and curricula, tailoring them independently according to their students' needs. This flexibility allows teachers to create an individualized curriculum for each child in pre-primary education.\n\nIn addition to their primary role as educators, teachers also play a significant part in job search networks. They can provide valuable connections and recommendations to those seeking employment opportunities within the educational field or related industries.\n\nLastly, teachers are often involved in providing short-term remedial education for children who may require additional support in specific subjects or skills. This role emphasizes their adaptability and commitment to ensuring every student receives a quality education.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n1013,KELA,1ST GRADE,Kela offers partial care allowance for children in the 1st grade,77\r\n775,ESPOO,PARENTS,\"The events took place in Espoo, Finland where parents participated with their children\",59\r\n1421,CHILDREN,PARENTS,\"If the parents do not have a common last name but they have children together, the child will have the same last name as his/her siblings\",42\r\n929,CHILD,1ST GRADE,The child is in the 1st grade,41\r\n2844,MUNICIPALITY,ADVISORY SERVICES,A municipality provides advisory services to parents,33\r\n2213,PARENTS,DISTRICT COURT,The matter will be solved in a district court if parents cannot agree on child maintenance support,14\r\n2208,PARENTS,1ST GRADE,Parents should come with the child to the dental examination during 1st grade,12\r\n2212,PARENTS,FAMILY MEDIATION,Parents can ask family mediation for help with child maintenance support disputes,12\r\n2206,GUARDIAN,PARENTS,The guardian is the birth mother of the child if the parents are not married and have not acknowledged paternity or maternity,12\r\n2209,PARENTS,ADVISORY SERVICES,Parents can ask advisory services about Swedish early childhood education,11\r\n2211,PARENTS,JOB,Parents get a job,11\r\n2210,PARENTS,TEACHERS,Parents can assist the instructors in the preparation of the plan for their child's education,10\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report should include the following sections:\r\n\r\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.

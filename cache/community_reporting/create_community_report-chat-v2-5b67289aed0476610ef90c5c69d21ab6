It is the amount of money paid to an individual for their work, which can vary depending on factors such as job difficulty, education, skills, and employer type. This payment represents the compensation earned by the employee for their work performed during a certain period of time. The average salary in Finland at the end of 2022 was approximately €3,800. In some cases, the concept of salary is also used to calculate the amount of earning-related daily allowance. However, it's important to note that the last salary may not have been paid yet.

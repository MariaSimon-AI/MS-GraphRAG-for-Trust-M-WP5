They are applying for a D visa or residence permit based on their family ties with a Finnish resident. However, it should be noted that this relationship does not necessarily include the status of husband/wife, cohabiting partner, minor children, or parents of minor children.\n\nThis Family Member may have various reasons for seeking residency in Finland. They could be applying due to their employment with a certified employer in Finland, or they might need assistance in obtaining death certificates or reports on the cause of death.\n\nIt is important to note that this Family Member, like any other, must comply with Finnish laws. Any instances of violence or threats of violence may disqualify them from obtaining a residence permit.\n\nThe relationship between this Family Member and the Finnish resident grants certain rights, such as the ability to work in Finland without restrictions. Additionally, this relationship could potentially affect the residence permit status of other related individuals. Lastly, if the Family Member is eligible for informal care allowance, this may also be a factor in their application process.\",15\r\n539,D VISA,\" The D VISA, as mentioned throughout the text, is a type of visa applied for through Enter Finland. It is specifically designed for individuals who have family members already living in Finland and working for a certified employer. This visa is valid for 100 days and can be attached to a passport by the Finnish Immigration Service. Upon being issued with a residence permit, this D VISA allows immediate travel to Finland. Therefore, it serves as a visa for moving to Finland based on family ties.\",8\r\n308,DIPLOMATIC MISSION,\" The Diplomatic Mission serves as an organization representing a nation within another country. Its primary function is to provide consular services to citizens of the home country residing abroad.

This mission is responsible for receiving visa applications and processing them accordingly. Additionally, it is the nearest Finnish Diplomatic Mission for visa-related information and the organization where paper forms and appendices can be submitted for immigration purposes in Finland.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n242,FINLAND,FAMILY MEMBER,\" Finland, as a country, extends an unlimited right to work to its citizens' family members. This means that these family members are legally permitted to take up employment within the Finnish territory. However, it is important to note that while family members of Finnish citizens have this right to work, they may still need to apply for a residence permit based on their family ties in order to legally reside in Finland. This residence permit would grant them the necessary authorization to live and work within the country.\",387\r\n422,FINLAND,D VISA,The card is delivered to Finland but not necessarily collected from by the intended recipient,380\r\n897,FAMILY MEMBER,PERSON,The person may have family members who act as caregivers,156\r\n620,RESIDENCE PERMIT,D VISA,The D visa leads to a residence permit in Finland,60\r\n902,FAMILY MEMBER,FINNISH IMMIGRATION SERVICE,The Finnish Immigration Service welcomes each family member according to what they are applying for,50\r\n1301,FINNISH IMMIGRATION SERVICE,D VISA,Finnish Immigration Service issues D visas to passport holders,43\r\n895,FAMILY MEMBER,D VISA,\" The D Visa is a type of residence permit that can be applied for by a Family Member who is currently residing in Finland.

They are applying for a D visa or residence permit based on their family ties with a Finnish resident. However, it should be noted that this relationship does not necessarily include the status of husband/wife, cohabiting partner, minor children, or parents of minor children.\n\nThis Family Member may have various reasons for seeking residency in Finland. They could be applying due to their employment with a certified employer in Finland, or they might need assistance in obtaining death certificates or reports on the cause of death.\n\nIt is important to note that this Family Member, like any other, must comply with Finnish laws. Any instances of violence or threats of violence may disqualify them from obtaining a residence permit.\n\nThe relationship between this Family Member and the Finnish resident grants certain rights, such as the ability to work in Finland without restrictions. Additionally, this relationship could potentially affect the residence permit status of other related individuals. Lastly, if the Family Member is eligible for informal care allowance, this may also be a factor in their application process.\",15\r\n557,CITIZENSHIP,\" Citizenship refers to the legal status of a person within a specific country, such as Finland. It grants rights and duties under the law of that nation. This legal status is crucial information for entering into the Finnish Population Information System via Enter Finland's online service. The process involves applying for a type of legal status known as citizenship. Citizenship statistics provide data related to this concept, offering insights into its distribution and trends within the country.\",11\r\n539,D VISA,\" The D VISA, as mentioned throughout the text, is a type of visa applied for through Enter Finland. It is specifically designed for individuals who have family members already living in Finland and working for a certified employer. This visa is valid for 100 days and can be attached to a passport by the Finnish Immigration Service. Upon being issued with a residence permit, this D VISA allows immediate travel to Finland. Therefore, it serves as a visa for moving to Finland based on family ties.\",8\r\n56,DISABLED,\" The entity referred to as \"\"DISABLED\"\" encompasses a group of individuals who are disabled and have specific needs in their daily lives and service requirements. These people may be eligible for informal care allowance due to their disability. They often require support and services, which can include supported housing in Finland. Furthermore, they possess a unique perspective on city activities, making them valuable contributors to community life. Due to mental, physical, or emotional impairments, they are unable to engage in normal physical activities or work.\",7\r\n54,ELDERLY,\" The elderly, as a group, refers to individuals who have reached a certain age and are eligible for various services and allowances. This demographic is often the focus of city activities, particularly in terms of understanding their unique perspectives and addressing their specific needs in daily life.

Additionally, they might participate in daytime activities organized by municipalities, and some may have attended Finnish courses. Overall, the elderly are a diverse group with distinct service requirements that need to be addressed effectively.\",7\r\n586,RESIDENCE PERMIT APPLICATION,\" The Residence Permit Application is an event that takes place at the Tampere service point of the Finnish Immigration Service.

Therefore, the Residence Permit Application is an important step in the process of obtaining legal residency within Finland.\",5\r\n175,RESIDENCE,\" The RESIDENCE under discussion is a temporary dwelling place, specifically for individuals who hold a Temporary Residence Permit in Finland. This residence is subject to assessment by Kela for permanency purposes. It meets the necessary requirements for obtaining a residence in Finland and serves as the location where an individual resides temporarily. Additionally, this residence is relevant when applying for both the national pension and guarantee pension in Finland.\",4\r\n1000,HUMAN TRAFFICKING,\" Human Trafficking is a global concept that encompasses the exploitation of individuals, often for forced labor or sexual purposes. It is considered a crime and has been reported in Finland, as well as other countries. In some cases, victims of human trafficking may seek residence permits in Finland due to their status as victims. This ground for applying for a residence permit in Finland is one of the ways the country addresses this issue.\",2\r\n1579,YOUR SPOUSE,,2\r\n108,FINNISH IMMIGRATION SERVICE,\" The Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto, Migri), located at various service points across Finland including Tutkijankuja 9, 90590 Oulu and Ajurinkatu 45, 70110 Kuopio, is the primary organization responsible for handling matters related to immigration, residence permits, and citizenship in Finland.

They offer services such as providing personal identity codes, registration certificates, and residence permits, including attaching D visas to passports.\n\nIn case of a deportation decision if a residence permit is not extended or decisions on residence permit cancellations, the Finnish Immigration Service plays a crucial role. They also handle applications for EU citizenship's right of permanent residence and seasonal work residence permits if working over 3 months.\n\nThe organization provides services via their website, email, phone, and service points, offering information on applying for temporary protection, lodging a citizenship notification, and more. They also offer interpreters to individuals in need. The Finnish Immigration Service sends press releases, customer bulletins, and invitations for asylum interviews via email.\n\nThe organization checks eligibility for permit extension, approves diplomas and school-leaving certificates for citizenship language proficiency proof, and investigates asylum applications and potential residence permits. They also run the detention units and are responsible for directing, planning, and supervising the practical detention unit operations.\n\nThe Finnish Immigration Service is a helpful resource for immigrants seeking to reside in Finland, providing comprehensive services related to immigration and residence permits.\",35\r\n109,ASYLUM,\" Asylum refers to a protection granted to individuals who fear persecution, conflict, or danger in their home country.

The process of seeking asylum is an event that adults can participate in and is related to the concept of seeking protection in a foreign country. In the given context, it refers to the Asylum unit within the framework.\n\nThe data also indicates that applying for asylum is an event that can be initiated by individuals who wish to seek protection in Finland. This process is outlined on the Finnish Immigration Service website and is specifically relevant to Russians seeking asylum. The Finnish Immigration Service will assess whether an applicant can receive asylum in Finland. Therefore, it can also be described as an event seeking protection from persecution or conflict in one's home country, and more specifically, an event seeking protection in Finland.\n\nIn summary, Asylum is a protection granted to individuals who fear persecution, conflict, or danger in their home country, and the process of seeking this protection in Finland is outlined on the Finnish Immigration Service website for Russians. The Finnish Immigration Service will assess whether an applicant can receive asylum in Finland.\",8\r\n863,PERSECUTION,\" Persecution refers to the act of violence, oppression, or discrimination inflicted upon an individual, group, or organization due to their identity, beliefs, race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, political belief, or any other characteristic that is protected by law. This act often instills fear and causes harm or oppression, compelling the affected party to seek refuge elsewhere.\",2\r\n519,RIGHT TO WORK,\" The entity known as \"\"Right to Work\"\" is a legal provision or law that grants individuals, particularly applicants, the unrestricted ability to seek and engage in employment. This right allows them to do so while their extended permit is being processed, during an appeal for an asylum application, or upon registration of their application for temporary protection with the police or border control authority. The right to work also applies to those who have been granted a residence permit, enabling them to perform the work for which they have been authorized. It is important to note that this right does not require employers to verify employee's eligibility to work in a specific field, and it does not affect one's residence permit status when performing voluntary work. The concept of \"\"Right to Work\"\" ensures that individuals can exercise their labor rights without facing restrictions or penalties.\",8\r\n1735,STATISTICS,\" Statistics refers to the collection, analysis, and presentation of numerical information or facts related to various subjects.

These statistics and situation reports provide insights into the state and operation of this particular system over a specific period.\",8\r\n3351,HOMES,\" The homes in question serve multiple purposes. Primarily, they are residential structures within housing estates and new buildings, providing living spaces for individuals and families. Additionally, these homes also function as places where the elderly reside, suggesting a focus on senior care or retirement living within some of these properties. Furthermore, it is noted that these homes are being rented out in Espoo by both private persons and companies, indicating a market for temporary or long-term housing solutions.\",3\r\n1578,SUFFICIENT INCOME,Amount of income needed to guarantee livelihood in Finland,3\r\n1452,INCOMES REGISTER, The INCOMES REGISTER is an online platform primarily utilized by individuals applying for a residence permit extension in Finland.

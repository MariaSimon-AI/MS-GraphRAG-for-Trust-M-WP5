These language courses typically begin either in August or September, or in January.\",3\r\n827,TIME,\" Time refers to a broad concept that encompasses various specific durations and instances. In the context provided, it is observed that Time includes the operational hours of health stations, which are from 8 am to 4 pm on weekdays. It also pertains to the period during which individuals must work and be a member of the unemployment fund for a certain duration to receive daily allowance. This could imply a specific time frame for employment or membership eligibility.\n\nTime is also associated with the part-time working arrangement for parents, where they can work in shifts or simultaneously, although the exact duration for this arrangement is not specified. The Time of asylum interviews, as stated in the invitation, is another instance within this context.\n\nIn addition, Time includes the time period during which health centres are open on weekdays, with conflicting information regarding the hours (8 am to 4 pm and 8 am to 4 pm or 8 am to 16 pm). The resolution of this contradiction suggests that the correct operational hours for health centers are from 8 am to 4 pm.\n\nTime is also related to the time period during which salary or wages should have been paid by the employer, although no specific duration is provided. Similarly, Time includes the application's validity, which lasts for a defined duration of 3 months. Lastly, Time does not seem to include the time when certificate exams can be obtained as this information is not specified in the text.\",11\r\n1599,INTEGRATION PLAN,\" The Integration Plan is a comprehensive strategy designed for each individual, aimed at facilitating their integration and maintaining a good quality of life in their new environment.

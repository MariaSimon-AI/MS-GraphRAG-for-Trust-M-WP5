It is the amount of money paid to an individual for their work, which can vary depending on factors such as job difficulty, education, skills, and employer type. This payment represents the compensation earned by the employee for their work performed during a certain period of time. The average salary in Finland at the end of 2022 was approximately €3,800. In some cases, the concept of salary is also used to calculate the amount of earning-related daily allowance. However, it's important to note that the last salary may not have been paid yet. The salary can be considered as the total amount owed to an employee for work performed during a specific period of time and serves as the payment made to an employee for their work or for work performed. In some instances, the labour hire agency pays the salary to the employee.\",19\r\n1035,UNEMPLOYMENT FUND,\" The UNEMPLOYMENT FUND is an organization that offers financial assistance to its members who find themselves unemployed, specifically within a particular field. It provides earnings-related unemployment allowance and daily allowance to these individuals. This organization serves as a crucial resource for information about unemployment benefits in Finland. Notably, the fees associated with this fund are fully deductible from earned income.\",5\r\n2004,CASH,\" Cash, often serving as a universal form of payment, is a currency primarily utilized for transactions when no other payment options are available. It is also employed in certain employment relationships to cover annual holiday payments. Specifically, it is the preferred method of payment for daily commuting expenses such as bus fares and taxi rides. However, it is important to note that cash is not commonly used in Finland for purchases.\",4\r\n2904,TRADE UNIONS,\" Trade Unions are organizations primarily concerned with labor relations and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. They serve as advocates for workers' rights, providing essential support and resources during challenging circumstances. Notably, these unions collaborate to establish minimum wages within their respective collective agreements.\",4\r\n667,WAGE,\" Wage, as a term, refers to the payment received by an employee for the work they perform. It is also one of the aspects of working conditions that are often negotiated by trade unions on behalf of their members. This dual nature reflects its role both as a financial compensation and a component of broader labor agreements aimed at improving workers' conditions.\",4\r\n2779,SKILLS,\" Skills refer to a set of abilities or competencies required to perform a task or job, which can be acquired and demonstrated. These abilities are specific to certain tasks or jobs and can influence salary amounts. In some contexts, skills may also denote the lack of abilities in areas such as Finnish or Swedish among children.\",4\r\n4876,EARNINGS-RELATED PENSION INSURANCE,Insurance that provides retirement benefits based on earnings during employment,1\r\n5111,EMPLOYER TYPE,\"Municipality, state, or company affecting salary amount\",1\r\n5110,JOB DIFFICULTY,Factor influencing salary amount,1\r\n4947,PAY STUB,\"Document that shows the details of an employee's salary payment, including deductions and taxes>\",1\r\n1055,PAYSLIP,\" A Payslip is a document issued by an employer, serving as a detailed record of an employee's earnings, wages, deductions, and other relevant financial information for a specific pay period.

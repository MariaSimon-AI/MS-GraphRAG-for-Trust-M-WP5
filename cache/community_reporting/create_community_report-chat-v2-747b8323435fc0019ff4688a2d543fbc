It was involved in conflicts with Russia, notably over Finland during a war that took place in the unspecified time period. During the Great Northern War of the 18th century, Sweden lost control of Helsinki to Russia on two occasions. In another conflict fought between 1808 and 1809, Sweden lost part of its territory to Russia.\n\nIn contemporary times, Sweden is a country where Finnish translations of driving licenses are accepted, and services such as Omnia's are available in both Finnish and English.

The TE Offices, presumably related to employment or education, are also located in Sweden.\n\nSwedish rental homes are typically not furnished by default, and the services of the Finnish Financial Ombudsman Bureau are available in addition to Finland. This suggests a close relationship between the two countries, as Swedish troops fought alongside Finnish forces during the Thirty Years' War.

It does not automatically grant the right to engage in other forms of work, but it may allow the holder to work in certain professions or countries.\n\nThe Residence Permit can be obtained through the Finnish Immigration Service's services and may be required for various purposes such as immigration, employment, student visas, or accessing certain services without personal payment. It is also necessary for city-owned rental apartment applications, registering as a jobseeker, and proving residency in Finland.\n\nThe Residence Permit can be lost or revoked under certain circumstances and policies, such as if the grounds on which it was granted no longer exist, due to divorce, or overstaying the permit's validity period. It may require a fee upon application and private insurance for medical and medicine costs.\n\nThe Residence Permit grants the holder permission to reside in the country, with associated rights and obligations.

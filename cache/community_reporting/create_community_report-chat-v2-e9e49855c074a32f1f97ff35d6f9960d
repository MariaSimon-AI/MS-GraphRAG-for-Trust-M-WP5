It serves as proof of identity when applying for various purposes such as registering as a jobseeker, opening a bank account, or even when submitting forms where the official identity card is not available. In some cases, it may also be required when applying for a residence permit. Additionally, in certain professions within Finland, obtaining a passport might be a specific requirement, similar to a working-life card but with a potentially longer process and timeframe.\",6\r\n367,BANK ACCOUNT,\" A Bank Account is a financial service provided by banks or other financial institutions, primarily used for handling day-to-day finances. It serves as a means to deposit and withdraw money, making it an essential tool for managing personal or business finances. These accounts can be opened using various forms of identification, including foreigner's identity cards in Finland. One common use of a bank account is for the deposit of regular income such as salary. For instance, in some cases, tax refund payments are made to the individual's bank account number.\",6\r\n765,WORK PERMIT,\" A Work Permit is a type of document issued by the government of a specific country, serving as legal authorization for a foreign citizen to work within that nation. This permit falls under the umbrella of the Temporary Residence Permit, indicating that it is intended for individuals who will reside in the country temporarily. Consequently, a Work Permit functions as a residence permit for foreign workers in the designated country.\",2\r\n299,TRAVEL DOCUMENT,\" The Travel Document, also known as a new passport, is a vital identification tool issued when the previous one expires.

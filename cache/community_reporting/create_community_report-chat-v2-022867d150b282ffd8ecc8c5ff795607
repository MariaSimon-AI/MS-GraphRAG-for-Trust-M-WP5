These municipalities play a crucial role in providing access to various public services for long-term residents who have been established in Finland. As such, they are entitled to use these services and are subject to the legal requirement of registration with their respective municipality.\n\nThe Municipalities of Residence also act as the residential areas that offer public health services to their residents. In some cases, the Digital and Population Data Services Agency may grant an individual a municipality of residence if they meet the necessary requirements. Furthermore, the TE Office can assign individuals to become clients of employment services within their respective municipalities of residence.\n\nIn addition, these municipalities serve as the concept related to eligibility for public services in Finland and the place where a person lives or considers their home. They are also responsible for providing documents for divorce proceedings abroad when required. However, it is important to note that the requirement can be waived if an individual stays less than a year in Finland.\n\nIn summary, the Municipalities of Residence in Finland are essential local authorities that provide various services and act as the primary dwelling location for individuals within the country, while also serving as the gateway to accessing public services and employment opportunities.\",7\r\n4934,DIGITAL AND POPULATION DATA AGENCY,Finnish authority providing documents for divorce proceedings abroad,1\r\n1761,MUNICIPALITY OF RESIDENCE REGISTRATION,,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,rank\r\n428,FINLAND,MUNICIPALITY OF RESIDENCE,\" Finland, as a sovereign nation, is geographically defined by its borders and houses various municipalities.

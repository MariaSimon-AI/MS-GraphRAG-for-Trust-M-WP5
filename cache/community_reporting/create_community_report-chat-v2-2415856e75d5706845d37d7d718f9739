The education system provides basic and upper secondary education through various programs. These educational programs can be applied for through a joint application process or continuously throughout the year. One of these programs is preparatory education for qualifications leading to an upper secondary diploma. This program is also offered in Finland by an organization known as YA, which provides basic vocational training. In summary, TUVA's education system offers a variety of educational opportunities, with a focus on both general and vocational education, and provides preparatory programs for upper secondary qualifications that can be applied for or enrolled in at any time during the year.\",7\r\n1606,VOCATIONAL EDUCATION,\" Vocational Education is a type of education that focuses on practical skills for a specific trade or occupation. It differs from general upper secondary school in being more practically oriented. This form of education provides specialized training, often leading to employment opportunities. As such, International House offers guidance in vocational education by appointment, one of the services they provide.\",2\r\n1492,SECONDARY EDUCATION,\" The Secondary Education refers to the level of education that young individuals are mandated to attain or surpass in accordance with compulsory education laws.

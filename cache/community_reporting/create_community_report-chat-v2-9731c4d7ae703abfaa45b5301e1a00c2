This process is outlined on the Finnish Immigration Service website and is specifically relevant to Russians seeking asylum. The Finnish Immigration Service will assess whether an applicant can receive asylum in Finland. Therefore, it can also be described as an event seeking protection from persecution or conflict in one's home country, and more specifically, an event seeking protection in Finland.\n\nIn summary, Asylum is a protection granted to individuals who fear persecution, conflict, or danger in their home country, and the process of seeking this protection in Finland is outlined on the Finnish Immigration Service website for Russians.

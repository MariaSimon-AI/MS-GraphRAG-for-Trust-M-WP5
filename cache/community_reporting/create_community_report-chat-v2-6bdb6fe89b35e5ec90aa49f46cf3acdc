In the Finnish context, this specific detached house is unique due to its inclusion of a private sauna. However, it's important to note that despite its appealing features, this type of house in Finland is known for having relatively high heating costs.\",3\r\n986,LOCAL NEWSPAPER,\" The LOCAL NEWSPAPER serves as a valuable resource for individuals seeking both rental dwellings and homes for sale. It functions as a medium that disseminates information about available housing options within the locality, catering to various housing needs in the community.\",2\r\n303,RENTAL DWELLING,\" The Rental Dwelling, a type of property being discussed, can be obtained from both public and private parties. It is a concept related to housing, specifically a dwelling that is rented rather than owned. This particular rental dwelling in question is the place where the tenant resides, and it was the subject of a potential eviction threat. The information about this rental dwelling can be found on Info Finland's page.\",9\r\n942,PRIVATE FLAT,\" The PRIVATE FLAT is currently under inspection, with the potential for it to be rented out. It is a property that has already been rented, although its current status suggests it may soon become available for rental again.\",6\r\n1601,NOTICE,\" The NOTICE, as an entity, is a written document that serves multiple purposes. Primarily, it functions as a legal document that must be submitted by employers to the relevant authorities in a timely manner.

In the tenancy agreement, they are designated as the landlord. They may provide recycling instructions upon request and require home insurance to be taken out for the property they rent out. In case of a tenant's death, it is necessary to inform the lessor. The LESSOR can also be described as the party who rented out the property and, in some instances, has been known to demand rent from tenants. However, it should be noted that while the LESSOR may have threatened eviction in the past, this does not necessarily imply a consistent or common practice.\",14\r\n5045,DEFECT,\" The term \"\"DEFECT\"\" refers to a flaw or imperfection that may be present in a rental dwelling, encompassing any kind of issue or shortcoming within the property. This could include problems with the structure, appliances, plumbing, electrical systems, or other aspects of the dwelling. It is important to note that this definition applies specifically to the context of a rental dwelling, although it can also be used more generally to describe any kind of flaw or imperfection in something, such as a dwelling.\",5\r\n943,LEASE AGREEMENT,\" The LEASE AGREEMENT is a legally binding document that outlines the terms and conditions of a rental contract between a landlord or lessor and a tenant.

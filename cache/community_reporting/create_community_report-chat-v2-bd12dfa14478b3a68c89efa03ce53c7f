They include offspring produced by parents and those who do not yet speak enough Finnish or Swedish. These children are also the recipients of learning support from both parents and teachers. They are entitled to a safe growing environment according to the Child Welfare Act, and they are eligible for free public oral health care under 18 years of age.\n\nChildren are also the target audience for leisure activities offered by Kokkola Region College and the recipients of meals at daycare and school. They can study Finnish or Swedish as a foreign language in S2 classes if their native language is not Finnish or Swedish. Their needs are considered in conciliation discussions, and they may have their own grounds for international protection.\n\nChildren are affected by rules regarding substances like cigarettes and alcohol, and they are the age group monitored by nurses at clinics. They can study with their parents or carers, and those whose Finnish language skills are not yet good enough to attend comprehensive school may require additional support.\n\nChildren are protected by the Finnish constitution, and working with them may require a criminal background check. They are involved in divorce cases and proceedings, and their living arrangements, custody, visitation rights, and child maintenance support are determined during these processes. They are also the focus of family activities organized by the City of Kauniainen.\n\nIn addition, children are encouraged to independent thinking, and they benefit from exercise and play regularly. They can access libraries in Finland, and their organization is considered in various activities. They must be protected from sexual harassment, and they may require a meal during the day.\n\nOverall, children are a diverse group of individuals with unique needs and rights that are recognized and protected by Finnish law and society.\",33\r\n904,112,\"112 is the emergency contact number in Finland, designed for calling in urgent matters such as accidents, seizures, threats, violence, or any other emergencies.

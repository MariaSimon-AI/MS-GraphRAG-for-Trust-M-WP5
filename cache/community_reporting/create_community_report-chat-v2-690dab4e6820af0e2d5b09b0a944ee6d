It encompasses various aspects such as finding living spaces, addressing housing issues, and providing solutions for those with disabilities or illnesses. The cost of housing varies significantly between major cities and small towns in Finland, but the differences are not as great as in countries with high income disparities. Housing is offered by both companies and private individuals, and its prices depend on factors like type and location. It can be a topic discussed in various contexts, such as the Youth Centre Vinge's information service, City of Tampere's services, or the discussion in Turku, where TVT Asunnot Oy provides housing units for rent.\",13\r\n3658,QUOTA REFUGEES,\" The QUOTA REFUGEES are individuals who fall under the target demographic for the Movingtofinland.fi website, and they represent a specific portion or quota of the total number of refugees permitted by a country within a particular timeframe. This quota system is in place to manage the influx of refugees into the host nation.\",4\r\n253,TEMPORARY PROTECTION,\" Temporary Protection, as granted in Finland, is a legal status offered to individuals who are temporarily unable to return to their home countries due to safety concerns. This status has been extended to asylum seekers and, during times of war, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, to Ukrainians residing in Finland. The Temporary Protection Law is enacted in response to specific situations, providing a residence permit under certain circumstances for individuals fleeing war-torn countries. These individuals are allowed to live in reception centers and utilize their services. It is important to note that temporary protection is granted to individuals who do not meet the criteria for refugee status but still require international protection. The concept of Temporary Protection is a subject of information provided by the Finnish Immigration Service, and it serves as a decision concerning the provision of residence permits under specific circumstances.\",4\r\n206,UKRAINE,\" Ukraine, a country currently embroiled in conflict, is experiencing the devastating effects of war. Despite these challenging circumstances, it continues to offer temporary protection to both its citizens and refugees who have been displaced as a result of the ongoing conflict.

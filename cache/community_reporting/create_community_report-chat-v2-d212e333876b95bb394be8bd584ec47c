It can be utilized for securing a service or benefit at a Finnish mission, applying for disability benefits, seeking refugee status or subsidiary protection, and obtaining a residence permit. The application process takes place within Finland, with the processing time ranging from 1-2 months to as long as 9-31 months depending on the specific application type.\n\nThe Application can also be used for changing the permit type, enrolling in study programs at universities, or requesting family reunification or extension of time to apply for a residence permit. For certain applications, such as those related to Early Childhood Education, it is necessary to submit the application four months before the desired start date.\n\nAdditionally, the Application may require specific documents like proof of origin and relationship, or a doctor's certificate/health statement if necessary. In some cases, the Application can be submitted electronically or in paper format, such as when applying for an EU_PYS certificate or filling out the citizenship application through KAN_2's online or paper process.\n\nThe Application process for obtaining a residence card and the residence permit also involves providing necessary attachments for dating relationships and residence permits for victims of human trafficking. The Application can also be used to initiate a divorce process by sending the required document to the District Court office by post or email. Lastly, the Application may be used in the process of registering the right of residence for a child or obtaining a library card.\n\nThroughout this process, it is important to choose the right application and ensure that all necessary documents are included. The Finnish Immigration Service will handle the processing of the Application.\",34\r\n4531,EU_KORTTI,Residence card for family members of EU citizens,3\r\n784,LANGUAGE COURSE,\" The Language Course is a type of educational offering that can be attended in Finland. Specifically, it is one of the courses provided by the Ylä-Savo Adult Education Centre. These language courses typically begin either in August or September, or in January.\",3\r\n3648,GOVERNMENT_AGENCY,Entity responsible for issuing residence permits in Finland,2\r\n827,TIME,\" Time refers to a broad concept that encompasses various specific durations and instances. In the context provided, it is observed that Time includes the operational hours of health stations, which are from 8 am to 4 pm on weekdays. It also pertains to the period during which individuals must work and be a member of the unemployment fund for a certain duration to receive daily allowance. This could imply a specific time frame for employment or membership eligibility.\n\nTime is also associated with the part-time working arrangement for parents, where they can work in shifts or simultaneously, although the exact duration for this arrangement is not specified. The Time of asylum interviews, as stated in the invitation, is another instance within this context.\n\nIn addition, Time includes the time period during which health centres are open on weekdays, with conflicting information regarding the hours (8 am to 4 pm and 8 am to 4 pm or 8 am to 16 pm). The resolution of this contradiction suggests that the correct operational hours for health centers are from 8 am to 4 pm.\n\nTime is also related to the time period during which salary or wages should have been paid by the employer, although no specific duration is provided. Similarly, Time includes the application's validity, which lasts for a defined duration of 3 months. Lastly, Time does not seem to include the time when certificate exams can be obtained as this information is not specified in the text.\",11\r\n1599,INTEGRATION PLAN,\" The Integration Plan is a comprehensive strategy designed for each individual, aimed at facilitating their integration and maintaining a good quality of life in their new environment. This plan encompasses measures such as Finnish language studies, other education, and practical training. It also includes approved components like reading and writing skills, as well as additional language training. The Integration Plan serves as a guide that needs to be followed, with the ultimate goal of helping individuals integrate into the workforce or society.\",4\r\n2817,DECISION,\" The Decision in question refers to a ruling or determination made in relation to an application for a change of permit type. This decision could potentially be related to a child's residence permit, as suggested by one description. However, it is important to clarify that the Decision itself is not a document issued by the Government Agency regarding the child's residence permit application, but rather a separate ruling or determination made in relation to that application. Furthermore, if this decision was contested, it could potentially lead to an appeal at the Administrative Court, as indicated by another description.\",4\r\n3820,VIDEO,\" The VIDEO, specifically, is a set of two digital video files.

It incurs a fee of 520 € per child and 270 € per child, indicating that multiple children can apply under one application with the total cost varying based on the number of children.

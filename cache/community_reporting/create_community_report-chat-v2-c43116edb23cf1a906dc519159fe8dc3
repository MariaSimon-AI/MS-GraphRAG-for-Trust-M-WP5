However, it is important to note that these services do not extend to those seeking private dental care in Kauniainen. Despite this limitation, the services provided by the government are available for free or at reduced costs. It should also be mentioned that these services are offered in Helsinki specifically for its residents.\",9\r\n45,CIRCUMCISION,\" Circumcision, as discussed in the text, is a concept that holds significance. It is essentially a medical procedure, which implies it involves the physical alteration of an individual's body under the supervision of a healthcare professional.

It was involved in conflicts with Russia, notably over Finland during a war that took place in the unspecified time period. During the Great Northern War of the 18th century, Sweden lost control of Helsinki to Russia on two occasions. In another conflict fought between 1808 and 1809, Sweden lost part of its territory to Russia.\n\nIn contemporary times, Sweden is a country where Finnish translations of driving licenses are accepted, and services such as Omnia's are available in both Finnish and English. Swedish courses are offered within the country, making it a place where Swedish is spoken. The TE Offices, presumably related to employment or education, are also located in Sweden.\n\nSwedish rental homes are typically not furnished by default, and the services of the Finnish Financial Ombudsman Bureau are available in addition to Finland. This suggests a close relationship between the two countries, as Swedish troops fought alongside Finnish forces during the Thirty Years' War. The Treaty of Nöteborg, which established the border regarding the Pyhäjoki river, was signed by both Sweden and another unspecified entity.\",11\r\n312,EU,\" The European Union (EU) is an international organization to which Finland joined in 1995. It serves as a customs and fiscal territory from which goods may move out of, and it is one of the member countries for which registration is possible through TE Office's online service. The EU is also a significant market where goods, including cars, are imported into.\n\nIn terms of cost, clothing in the EU might be compared to that in Finland. The EU offers an online service available for its citizens to register as jobseekers. For those living in the EU, time spent there may be partially considered for eligibility for certain benefits or programs. Additionally, the EU has a permit exemption for buying real estate with an EU or EEA spouse. Furthermore, EU citizens can apply for ARA housing within the Union. However, it is important to note that in this context, the EU itself is not a data subject.\",9\r\n1012,OMNIA,\" OMNIA is a multifaceted organization based in Espoo, Finland. Primarily, it offers career counseling services to individuals seeking guidance in their professional paths. This service is provided in both Finnish and English, catering to a diverse clientele.\n\nIn addition to career counseling, OMNIA provides vocational education within its scope. It also holds the National Certificate of Language Proficiency exams, demonstrating its expertise in language assessment.\n\nFurthermore, OMNIA offers preparatory education for upper secondary qualification (TUVA) and general upper secondary school. This indicates that it plays a significant role in preparing students for their future academic endeavors. Overall, OMNIA is a comprehensive educational institution offering a range of services to support individuals in Finland and Sweden in their professional and academic journeys.\",5\r\n2504,CREDIT CARD,Type of payment card used in Finland for purchases,4\r\n2503,DEBIT CARD,Type of payment card used in Finland for purchases,4\r\n2505,NORWAY,\" Norway, a country not included in the list of EU members such as Liechtenstein, Switzerland, or Iceland, shares a border with Finland and did not join the European Union in 1995. However, it maintains a close relationship with the EU through the European Economic Area agreement. This Scandinavian nation is known for its widespread use of debit/credit cards for purchases.

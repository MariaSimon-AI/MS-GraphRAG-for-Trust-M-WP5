It can be utilized for securing a service or benefit at a Finnish mission, applying for disability benefits, seeking refugee status or subsidiary protection, and obtaining a residence permit. The application process takes place within Finland, with the processing time ranging from 1-2 months to as long as 9-31 months depending on the specific application type.\n\nThe Application can also be used for changing the permit type, enrolling in study programs at universities, or requesting family reunification or extension of time to apply for a residence permit. For certain applications, such as those related to Early Childhood Education, it is necessary to submit the application four months before the desired start date.\n\nAdditionally, the Application may require specific documents like proof of origin and relationship, or a doctor's certificate/health statement if necessary. In some cases, the Application can be submitted electronically or in paper format, such as when applying for an EU_PYS certificate or filling out the citizenship application through KAN_2's online or paper process.\n\nThe Application process for obtaining a residence card and the residence permit also involves providing necessary attachments for dating relationships and residence permits for victims of human trafficking. The Application can also be used to initiate a divorce process by sending the required document to the District Court office by post or email. Lastly, the Application may be used in the process of registering the right of residence for a child or obtaining a library card.\n\nThroughout this process, it is important to choose the right application and ensure that all necessary documents are included. The Finnish Immigration Service will handle the processing of the Application.\",34\r\n3820,VIDEO,\" The VIDEO, specifically, is a set of two digital video files.

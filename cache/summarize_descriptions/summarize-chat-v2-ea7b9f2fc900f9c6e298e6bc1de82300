{"result": " Divorce, in this context, refers to the legal dissolution of a marriage or registered partnership. It is an event that ends a union between two individuals and may require their separation for at least two years without a reconsideration period. This process can be initiated by either spouse and does not necessitate the permission of a previous spouse to remarry.\n\nIn Finland, divorce proceedings are applied for in two phases and are handled by the District Court. The event may impact an individual's residence permit in the country. It is also associated with various family-related matters such as living arrangements, custody, visitation rights, and child maintenance allowance. In cases involving children, a child welfare supervisor might be involved to determine living arrangements, custody, visitation rights, and child maintenance support.\n\nIndividuals seeking help or more information on divorce, family mediation, or related matters can find resources on Info Finland's web page. The process of divorce may also necessitate appointments with Family Counselling Centres for further assistance. It is important to note that divorce, being a legal event, may have significant implications on the lives of those involved and should be approached with careful consideration.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

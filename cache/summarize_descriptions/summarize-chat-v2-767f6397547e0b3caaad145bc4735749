{"result": " The entity known as \"Right to Work\" is a legal provision or law that grants individuals, particularly applicants, the unrestricted ability to seek and engage in employment. This right allows them to do so while their extended permit is being processed, during an appeal for an asylum application, or upon registration of their application for temporary protection with the police or border control authority. The right to work also applies to those who have been granted a residence permit, enabling them to perform the work for which they have been authorized. It is important to note that this right does not require employers to verify employee's eligibility to work in a specific field, and it does not affect one's residence permit status when performing voluntary work. The concept of \"Right to Work\" ensures that individuals can exercise their labor rights without facing restrictions or penalties.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

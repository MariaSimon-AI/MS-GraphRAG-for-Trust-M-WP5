{"result": " The Right of Residence is a legal entitlement granted to both EU citizens and certain individuals who have been legally admitted into a country, subject to meeting specific conditions. This right can be potentially revoked if the individual violates the terms of their visa or residency permit, commits a crime, or fails to meet certain requirements. It's important to note that while it cannot be registered without a job or other specified reason initially, it must be registered for the child born in Finland.

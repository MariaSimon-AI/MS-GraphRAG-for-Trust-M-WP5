{"result": " The Population Information System, primarily utilized in Finland, serves as a comprehensive database for managing personal data of its residents. This includes citizens as well as foreigners residing temporarily or permanently within the country. The system is instrumental in registering various details such as native languages, addresses, and identity codes of individuals.\n\nOne of its key functions is the registration of children, including their parents as guardians. Additionally, it serves as a temporary address registration system for new arrivals in Finland.

{"result": " Finland, a Nordic country known for its long winters, experiences limited sunlight throughout the year, which results in a higher prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency among its population, particularly among children. This is primarily due to the lack of adequate exposure to sunlight and insufficient intake of Vitamin D through diet. Consequently, it is recommended that children in Finland consume more foods rich in Vitamin D or consider supplementation during the winter months to maintain optimal health and prevent deficiency-related complications.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

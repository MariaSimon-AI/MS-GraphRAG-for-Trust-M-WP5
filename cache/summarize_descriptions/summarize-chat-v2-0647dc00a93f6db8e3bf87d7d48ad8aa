{"result": " The term \"PARENTS\" refers to adults who are primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of a child. They play an essential role in pre-primary education, making decisions regarding their child's religious affiliation, and often participate in various activities together. These parents may be involved in therapy sessions for young people, either individually or collectively as part of an organization.\n\nIn some cases, these parents may be divorced or have ended a common-law relationship. They might also be unmarried and have not acknowledged paternity or maternity of their child. Some parents may face challenges in agreeing on child maintenance support.\n\nParents who reside in Oulu and have children eligible for family clubs organized by the city will receive peer support from other parents. The last name given to a child is often derived from the parents.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

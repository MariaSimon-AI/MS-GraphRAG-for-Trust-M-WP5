{"result": " The term \"IMMIGRANT\" refers to individuals who have moved from one country to another, either permanently or temporarily. These immigrants reside in Finland primarily due to work, family ties, and studies. They are often the target of various programs and services designed to facilitate their integration into Finnish society and the workforce. This includes education in Finland, Finnish language courses, integration training, and preparatory training for working life.\n\nImmigrants have the option to study their own mother tongue, but it is also mandatory for them to study Finnish for at least two hours per week during basic education. The Tampere Adult Education Centre provides these courses.\n\nIn addition, immigrants can receive help from services such as Miehen Linja, Hilma, International House Helsinki, and International House Turku. These entities offer assistance to foreign-born individuals residing in Finland permanently or temporarily. They provide services like vocational labor market training, business briefings, and initial assessments in places like Vantaa.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that some immigrants may face challenges such as working without proficiency in Finnish in certain sectors like cleaning, construction, restaurant, and transport. Some immigrants might also be held in detention units while their immigration status is being determined.\n\nLastly, the recipients of the first-phase services provided by Sarvis Social Office are also considered immigrants.

{"result": " The entity known as FEES encompasses two distinct yet related aspects. Firstly, it refers to fees that applicants must pay when applying for a residence permit based on family ties. Secondly, it pertains to costs associated with early childhood education. In the context of early childhood education, these fees depend on the income of the family and can amount to approximately €300 for the oldest child in municipal early childhood education.

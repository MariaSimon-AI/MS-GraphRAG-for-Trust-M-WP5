{"result": " Temporary Protection, as granted in Finland, is a legal status offered to individuals who are temporarily unable to return to their home countries due to safety concerns. This status has been extended to asylum seekers and, during times of war, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, to Ukrainians residing in Finland. The Temporary Protection Law is enacted in response to specific situations, providing a residence permit under certain circumstances for individuals fleeing war-torn countries. These individuals are allowed to live in reception centers and utilize their services. It is important to note that temporary protection is granted to individuals who do not meet the criteria for refugee status but still require international protection. The concept of Temporary Protection is a subject of information provided by the Finnish Immigration Service, and it serves as a decision concerning the provision of residence permits under specific circumstances.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

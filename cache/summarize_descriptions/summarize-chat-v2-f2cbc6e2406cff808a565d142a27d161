{"result": " The Residence Permit is a legal document that allows an individual, whether a student, specialist, or foreigner with family ties, to reside in a specific country, such as Finland, for a specified period of time. This permit can be granted based on various grounds, including family ties, a degree, an intergovernmental agreement, or a specific profession. It does not automatically grant the right to engage in other forms of work, but it may allow the holder to work in certain professions or countries.\n\nThe Residence Permit can be obtained through the Finnish Immigration Service's services and may be required for various purposes such as immigration, employment, student visas, or accessing certain services without personal payment. It is also necessary for city-owned rental apartment applications, registering as a jobseeker, and proving residency in Finland.\n\nThe Residence Permit can be lost or revoked under certain circumstances and policies, such as if the grounds on which it was granted no longer exist, due to divorce, or overstaying the permit's validity period. It may require a fee upon application and private insurance for medical and medicine costs.\n\nThe Residence Permit grants the holder permission to reside in the country, with associated rights and obligations. The process of applying, renewing, appealing decisions regarding, and leaving and re-entering the country with a Residence Permit is managed by the Finnish Immigration Service. The types of Residence Permits available include those for long-term stay, temporary stay, students, family members, and work permits.\n\nThe subject of this data is Residence Permits, specifically those issued by the Finnish Immigration Service to allow individuals to reside in Finland temporarily or permanently.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

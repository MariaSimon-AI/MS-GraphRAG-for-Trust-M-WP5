The language is also used in legal advice during employment counselling sessions, available on the websites of business advice centres, and offered in integration training by TE Office.\n\nIn the academic sphere, Finnish is predominantly used in most university degree programmes in Finland. It is also the main language of mentoring programs, aimed at improving the quality and management of one's own life both within and outside working life.

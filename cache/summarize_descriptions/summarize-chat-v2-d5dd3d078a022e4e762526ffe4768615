{"result": " Housing refers to accommodation, whether provided by the government or self-funded, and is a crucial concept for asylum seekers, individuals seeking help from Ohjaamo, and those in need of information on housing in Finland. It encompasses various aspects such as finding living spaces, addressing housing issues, and providing solutions for those with disabilities or illnesses. The cost of housing varies significantly between major cities and small towns in Finland, but the differences are not as great as in countries with high income disparities. Housing is offered by both companies and private individuals, and its prices depend on factors like type and location. It can be a topic discussed in various contexts, such as the Youth Centre Vinge's information service, City of Tampere's services, or the discussion in Turku, where TVT Asunnot Oy provides housing units for rent.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

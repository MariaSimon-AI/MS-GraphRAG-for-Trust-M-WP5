{"result": " The European Union (EU) is an international organization to which Finland joined in 1995. It serves as a customs and fiscal territory from which goods may move out of, and it is one of the member countries for which registration is possible through TE Office's online service. The EU is also a significant market where goods, including cars, are imported into.\n\nIn terms of cost, clothing in the EU might be compared to that in Finland. The EU offers an online service available for its citizens to register as jobseekers. For those living in the EU, time spent there may be partially considered for eligibility for certain benefits or programs. Additionally, the EU has a permit exemption for buying real estate with an EU or EEA spouse. Furthermore, EU citizens can apply for ARA housing within the Union.

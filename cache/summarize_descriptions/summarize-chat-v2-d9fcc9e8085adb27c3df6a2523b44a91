It is possible for a child to acquire citizenship through birth in Finland. However, this information may be somewhat misleading, as Liechtenstein is not an EU member country in the traditional sense. Nevertheless, it is one of the EU member countries where registration can be facilitated through the TE Office's online service, and it is also among the EU member states that can utilize the TE Services' E-services.

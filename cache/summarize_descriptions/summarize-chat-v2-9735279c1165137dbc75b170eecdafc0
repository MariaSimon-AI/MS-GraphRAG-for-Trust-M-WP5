{"result": " The Municipalities of Residence in Finland are local government areas where individuals reside, serving as the primary dwelling location within the country. These municipalities play a crucial role in providing access to various public services for long-term residents who have been established in Finland. As such, they are entitled to use these services and are subject to the legal requirement of registration with their respective municipality.\n\nThe Municipalities of Residence also act as the residential areas that offer public health services to their residents. In some cases, the Digital and Population Data Services Agency may grant an individual a municipality of residence if they meet the necessary requirements. Furthermore, the TE Office can assign individuals to become clients of employment services within their respective municipalities of residence.\n\nIn addition, these municipalities serve as the concept related to eligibility for public services in Finland and the place where a person lives or considers their home.

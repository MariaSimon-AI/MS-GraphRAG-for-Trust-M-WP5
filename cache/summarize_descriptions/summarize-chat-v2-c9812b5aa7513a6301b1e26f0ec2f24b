{"result": " Preparatory Education is an additional educational program designed to prepare students, particularly non-Finnish speaking individuals, for upper secondary school. This type of education serves as a bridge for immigrants, helping them acquire the necessary skills and knowledge for further studies or employment in Finland. The preparatory education lasts for a year before continuing to Basic Education. It is provided to children aged 7 to 16 who do not yet have sufficient skills in Finnish or Swedish. During this period, pupils study all subjects in Finnish and familiarize themselves with Finnish culture and various learning environments, thereby enhancing their proficiency in the language.

{"result": " English is a language that is provided as a service by Kajaani International Info and is commonly used for various purposes across Finland. It is available in nearly all institutes of higher education in Finland, including Espoo, and also in Sweden. In larger cities like Oulu, Helsinki, and Vaasa, English is spoken in shops, offices, day-care centers, and some workplaces by immigrants who are still learning Finnish. It is also the language of instruction in international schools, universities, and some study programs in Finland's institutes of higher education.\n\nIn addition, English is used for communication in businesses, financial institutions like the Finnish Financial Ombudsman Bureau, and during counseling sessions provided by organizations such as Familia Club's Duo Project and Luckan Integration. It is also one of the languages in which some Addiction Link services are available.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that English may not be fully understood by emergency service operators and may require tuition fees for international students in Finnish higher education institutes. Also, while English books can be found in Helsinki libraries, they are not the majority language.\n\nLastly, English is one of the languages in which some driving license translations are accepted in Finland. The language is spoken by staff at institutions like Nollalina and some units in Pyhäjoki, and it is the language of education provided at Varia.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

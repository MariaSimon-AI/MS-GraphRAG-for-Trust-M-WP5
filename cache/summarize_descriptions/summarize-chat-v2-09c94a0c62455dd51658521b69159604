{"result": " The TE Office, also known as the Employment and Economic Development Office, serves as a comprehensive center for employment assistance and integration in Finland. It is an organization that provides services for appointments and changes of appointments, job search information, and labor policy statement validity checks without requiring prior appointments. This entity is responsible for conducting preliminary assessments and creating integration plans if an individual is not already a client of the TE Office.\n\nThe TE Office offers various services, including work trials without pay, employment assistance, and integration assistance. It serves as a provider of online services through its E-Services website, where citizens can register as job-seekers, register unemployment, or fill out forms if they do not have online banking identifiers or an identity card with a chip.\n\nFor those unable to fill the form online, the TE Office allows for in-person registration. It also provides guidance and information on job search, vacancies, training, and services for the unemployed. The TE Office is responsible for handling unemployment benefits and determining eligibility during an integration plan.\n\nIn addition, the TE Office offers integration training for its customers, Finnish and Swedish courses, start-up grants, and assistance with travel plans within Finland. It is also the place where job seekers should start their job search and register in Finland. For EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland citizens, the TE Office provides an online service for registering as job-seekers.\n\nThe TE Office may assign individuals to become clients of its employment services, and if necessary, it will guide them to integration training.

{"result": " A Doctor, as a healthcare professional regulated by law in Finland, is a medical expert who provides comprehensive medical care to individuals. They are trained to diagnose and treat various illnesses or injuries, prescribe medication or surgery when necessary, and offer prenatal care for expecting mothers, including delivering babies. Doctors can also be seen for consultations regarding abortions, STD tests, and mental health services, and they write prescriptions for medicines.\n\nIn addition to their clinical roles, doctors serve as confidential advisors, meaning patients can discuss their health concerns with them without fear of judgment or breach of privacy. They are also qualified to perform certain procedures such as circumcisions, under specific circumstances. Doctors work at hospitals, health and social services centers, health stations, and schools, and they may refer patients to specialists if necessary.\n\nFurthermore, doctors are notified when someone dies outside a hospital, indicating their role in both life-saving care and end-of-life situations. They evaluate the health of children and write referrals for further treatment if required. Overall, a doctor is an essential figure in the healthcare system, providing vital medical services to individuals across various stages of life.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

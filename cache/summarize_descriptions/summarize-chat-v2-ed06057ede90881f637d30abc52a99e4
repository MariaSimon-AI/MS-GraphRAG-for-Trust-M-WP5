{"result": " The Studies in question refer to academic work undertaken by students at the Higher University of Applied Sciences, which can also be pursued at other educational institutions such as the School of Visual Arts in Espoo, Finland. These studies are practical and lead to a profession upon graduation, providing all-round education. They can last for approximately 4 years depending on the program and individual pace, but may extend beyond that through further training, continuing education, or university studies.\n\nThe Studies can be completed in various ways, including on-the-job learning, and they offer a practical training period as part of the curriculum. These Studies are considered educational activities that can serve as grounds for a residence permit, and they may also qualify for unemployment benefits when pursued for vocational training, higher education, or job-specific skills training.\n\nOhjaamo can assist with various matters related to these Studies, including practical exercises and other aspects of the learning process.

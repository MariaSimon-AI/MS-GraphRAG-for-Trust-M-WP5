{"result": " Marriage, under Finnish law, is a legally recognized union between two individuals, voluntarily chosen and entered into. It is a concept that acknowledges and confirms maternity when parents are married, and it signifies a commitment between the couple to contribute to shared finances and subsistence. Civil marriages are conducted at the Digital and Population Data Services Agency and require an appointment for examination of potential impediments under Finnish law. Marriage is not a requirement for the couple living in Finland or for Finnish citizenship by notification, but it may affect the residence permit in Finland. Marriage can be dissolved by filing for divorce, and if a divorce application has been filed, the marriage is considered to have ended. Marriage-related services are offered at family counselling centres, and marriages that have ended are subject to investigation or examination of potential impediments.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

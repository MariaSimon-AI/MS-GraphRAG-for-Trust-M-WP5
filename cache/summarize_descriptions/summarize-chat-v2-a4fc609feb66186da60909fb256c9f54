{"result": " Jorvi Hospital, situated in Espoo, serves as a crucial healthcare facility. It offers emergency care specifically for children under the age of 16, making it the closest clinic for urgent illnesses and accidents involving this demographic. Interestingly, despite being primarily a pediatric emergency center, it is also recognized as the nearest emergency clinic for adults in the area. This apparent contradiction can be resolved by understanding that while Jorvi Hospital prioritizes pediatric care, it does provide emergency services for all ages when necessary. Furthermore, Jorvi Hospital is part of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, a network of healthcare institutions in the region.", "input": "You are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\r\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\r\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

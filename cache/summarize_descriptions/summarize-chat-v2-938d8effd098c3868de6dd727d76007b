{"result": " The Worker's Residence Permit is a document issued to foreign workers, allowing them to reside in a particular country while employed by a specific employer. This permit grants the worker the right to live and work within the borders of that country. However, it should be noted that this permit may also allow workers to switch jobs within the same professional field, provided that the new employment opportunity does not require a change in the nature of their profession or a specific employer restriction.

{"result": "1. The text discusses the process of obtaining a residence permit for research in the European Union (EU).\n\n2. There are two types of residence permits mentioned: a residence permit for research under the EU Directive and a national residence permit for research.\n\n3. To be eligible for a residence permit for research under the EU Directive, a person must hold a master's degree (a second-cycle degree) and have signed an agreement on research activity with a research organization. If granted, this permit allows the holder to move and reside freely within the territory of the EU.\n\n4. To be eligible for a national residence permit for research, a person must hold a bachelor’s degree (a first-cycle degree) and have signed an agreement on research activity with a research organization.\n\n5. It is not possible to be granted a residence permit for research under the Directive in certain situations, such as when applying for asylum in Finland, having been granted international protection in an EU Member State, or receiving a decision on deportation from Finland.\n\n6. The text also mentions that if a researcher with a residence permit under the Directive wishes to conduct part of their research in a second EU Member State, they should check with the competent authorities of that state to see if a mobility notification is required.\n\n7. A residence permit under the Directive is a continuous residence permit (an A permit).\n\n8.

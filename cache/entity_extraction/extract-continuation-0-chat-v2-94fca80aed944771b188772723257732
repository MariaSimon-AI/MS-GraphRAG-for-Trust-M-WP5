The different kinds of seasonal work permits are visa for seasonal work, certificate for seasonal work and residence permit for seasonal work. The duration of your work will affect which seasonal work permit you need to apply for. Seasonal work refers to work in agriculture and tourism that is tied to a certain time of the year. The maximum duration of seasonal work is nine months within a 12-month period. The types of seasonal work to which the Seasonal Workers Act is applied include agricultural and garden work, forestry and work in the tourism sector. See a more detailed list of seasonal jobs on the page What counts as seasonal work? You cannot get a seasonal work permit on the basis of wild-berry picking. Instead, you need to apply for a residence permit for an employed person. One of the requirements for granting the permit is that you have an employment relationship in order to pick wild berries. The Seasonal Workers Act also applies to temporary agency work. When you are in Finland with a residence permit for seasonal work, your family members cannot be granted a residence permit in Finland on the basis of family ties.\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

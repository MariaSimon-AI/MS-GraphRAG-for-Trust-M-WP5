{"result": "1. The text discusses residence permits and work permissions within the Schengen area for individuals who are not citizens of the member countries.\n\n2. It is stated that an initial application for a residence permit based on employment is still being processed, but work without a residence permit is allowed under certain conditions such as exceptions or visa exemptions. However, this permission only lasts until the expiration of the visa or exemption from visa.\n\n3. If a person has already been granted a residence permit for employment or any other reason that allows them to work, they may continue working in the same field during the processing of their extended permit, provided they have applied for an extension before the expiry of their previous permit.\n\n4. It is clarified that a Finnish residence permit does not allow individuals to take paid employment in other countries within the Schengen area. They can travel to these countries for a short period but are not allowed to work there.\n\n5. If an individual wishes to live or work in another country in the Schengen area, they need to contact the authorities of that specific country to determine the type of permit required.\n\n6. Regardless of the type of residence permit (A, B or P) or the reasons for its granting, a Finnish residence permit allows an individual to visit other countries within the Schengen area for no more than 90 days at a time. This is the longest total consecutive time they may spend outside Finland in other Schengen countries, not just in one country.", "input": "\r\n-Goal-\r\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\r\n \r\n-Steps-\r\n1.

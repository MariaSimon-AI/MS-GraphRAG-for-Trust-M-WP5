As a Union citizen, you are free to enter Finland without a visa and reside in Finland for a maximum period of three months without registering your right of residence. In order to enter the country and reside there you must have a valid identity card or passport. As a Union citizen you must register your right of residence at the latest when three months have elapsed from your entry into the country. Decisions on registering Union citizens are made by the Finnish Immigration Service. You can find further instructions on the registration of your right of residence here. Registration takes place at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service and a written certificate of the registration will be issued to you (certificate of registration of the right of residence of a Union citizen). If you are a citizen of the Nordic countries, however, your registration will be handled by the local register office. In exceptional circumstances, Union citizens may be issued with a residence permit if they are unable to register on account of a lack of funds and if they were entitled to a residence permit without meeting the income requirement or if an exception could be made in a particular case concerning the income requirement. Leave your residence permit application to the Finnish Immigration Service. I am an EU citizen and have come to Finland to marry a Finn. I have resided in Finland for three months and would like to register.

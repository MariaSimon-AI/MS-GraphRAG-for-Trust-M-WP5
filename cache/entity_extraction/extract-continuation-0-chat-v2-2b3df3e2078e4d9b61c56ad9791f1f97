This means that you log in using your online banking credentials, mobile certificate or citizen certificate. You add the photograph retrieval code for your digital passport photo to your application. The code is given to you by the photo shop. You pay for the application before you submit it. A residence permit card is valid for up to 5 years. This is due to the fact that the card’s chip contains biometric identifiers. To ensure the data security of the chip, the card has to be renewed every 5 years. The period of validity of your residence permit is printed on the residence permit card. If your permit expires, you cannot apply for an extension by applying for a new residence permit card.

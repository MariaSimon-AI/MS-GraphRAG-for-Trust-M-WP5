A child’s grounds for international protection may be stronger than an adult’s. Children may also have their own grounds for asylum independently of their parents. There are also forms of persecution that only affect children. All this, together with the security situation in the child’s home region, is taken into account in asylum decisions. When a child’s best interests are assessed, we take into account the child’s family ties and other close relationships as well as the child’s religious, linguistic and cultural background. Also any individual needs concerning, for instance, the child’s development or health are taken into account. What does the law say about interviewing children? In Finland, provisions on interviewing minors are laid down in the Aliens Act (see section 6 of the Aliens Act). The Finnish Immigration Service has been conducting separate interviews with all co-applicants who have turned 12, and the agency will keep doing so even in the future. That is a statutory duty. The agency has also interviewed younger co-applicants if it has been deemed necessary. Interviewing minors is and has been an important way of assessing what would be in a child’s best interests in his or her situation. Children are always interviewed in accordance with their age and maturity. This is a statutory duty laid down in the Aliens Act. Why do you interview children whose parents have converted to Christianity? If a child is a member of a religious community, it can affect the child's risk of facing persecution in his or her\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

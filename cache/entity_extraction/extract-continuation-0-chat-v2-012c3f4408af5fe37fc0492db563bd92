You can work for the new employer for as long as your current seasonal work permit is valid. For more information, see: How to apply for the addition of a new employer. If your employment with the new employer will last longer than your seasonal work permit is valid, you must apply for a new residence permit, not the addition of a new employer. Please use the Application Finder to check which permit you should apply for. Does the employer have to pay the minimum wage according to the collective agreement? A seasonal worker who comes to Finland must have sufficient financial resources secured by income from gainful employment, and your wage must be at minimum in accordance with the collective agreement that applies to your employment relationship. What details does my employer need to provide for the application? The employer must always fill in the terms of employment in an application concerning seasonal work. The fastest way to do this is to log in to Enter Finland for Employers and fill in the details under 'waiting for work conditions'. If the employer cannot use Enter Finland for Employers, the employer must use the paper form TY6_plus to submit the terms of employment. The form covers basic information about the employer, the employee and the terms of employment. \"The applicant must have appropriate accommodation. \" What does this mean?

No, your required period of residence is 8 years. Your period of residence is calculated from the date when you received your first continuous residence permit (an A permit). In some cases, a shorter period of residence is enough. See the page Period of residence for more information. 17. I have lived in Finland for 4 years and I have the required language skills. Can I be granted Finnish citizenship? No, not yet. If you have the required language skills, you must have lived in Finland for 5 years. 18. I applied for an extended permit too late. How will this affect my period of residence? The time without a valid residence permit will not be counted as part of your period of residence. Applications for an extended permit must be submitted before the old residence permit expires. The time you reside in Finland without a residence permit is illegal residence. 19. Is the reason why I have spent time abroad, outside Finland, of any relevance to the interruption of continuous residence? The reason why you have lived abroad is not relevant, except when there is a well-founded personal reason. Your period of residence will interrupt if, for instance, your Finnish employer has sent you abroad on assignment and the period of absence from Finland is too long. Read more about calculating the period of residence and travelling abroad. 20. Next year, I will have lived in Finland for the period of residence required for citizenship.

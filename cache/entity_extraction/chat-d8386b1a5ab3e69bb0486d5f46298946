If you have applied for a residence permit using the application for an employed person, specialist, the EU Blue Card, athlete, person with a degree or research completed in Finland, or other employment, and meet the requirements for the residence permit based on your application documents, the Finnish Immigration Service will grant you the permit without additional steps. In other cases, we will contact you or your employer. What happens if my application, which is already pending, does not meet the requirements set in the new law? If you have, for example, applied for a\nresidence permit for a specialist, but your salary no longer meets the criteria set for specialists, or applied for a residence permit on the basis of other employment as the employee of an association, but do not work in the service of a religious community in a position that involves practising the religion, it is possible that you cannot be granted the residence permit for which you have applied. In such cases, the Finnish Immigration Service will contact you asking you to change your application and apply instead for a residence permit for an employed person (TTOL), for example. You will also receive instructions on how to pay the difference in the processing fees for the permits. If you do not agree to change your application or pay the difference in the processing fees, we may not be able to grant you a residence permit.

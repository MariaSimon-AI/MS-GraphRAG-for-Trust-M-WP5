I have a Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Do I still need to have insurance? No, you don’t. A valid UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) is regarded as sufficient proof of insurance. Your health insurance card must be valid for the duration of your stay in Finland. I have a Kela card in Finland. Do I need to have insurance? As a student, you do not need to have insurance if you have a municipality of residence in Finland and a Kela card. If you do not have a municipality of residence in Finland but you have a Kela card, you can ask Kela to issue you with a certificate of entitlement to medical care. When you have a Kela card, you are covered under the National Health Insurance scheme, but it does not mean the same thing as being entitled to treatment in the public healthcare system in Finland. With the Kela card, you are entitled to receive reimbursement for the costs of medicines and fees of private doctors. If you have a municipality of residence in Finland, you are entitled to treatment in the public healthcare system.

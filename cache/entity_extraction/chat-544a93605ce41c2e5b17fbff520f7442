For more information on how to renew your residence permit card, please visit the page Renewal of a residence permit card. I have received a residence permit card, but there is incorrect information on the card. What should I do? Inform the Finnish Immigration Service in writing about the incorrect information. Specify what information should be corrected and in what way. Remember to also include your contact information. The Finnish Immigration Service will determine the cause of the incorrect information. After this, the Finnish Immigration Service will let you know if the information will be corrected without a new application or if you need to apply for a new card. I have a permanent residence permit sticker in my passport. My passport is about to expire. What should I do? You must apply for a new passport from the same authorities who issued your previous passport. Usually this means your own country's embassy in Finland. If you have an alien's passport or a refugee travel document issued by Finland, you must submit a re-application at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service. The residence permit sticker will not be transferred to your new passport, instead you must apply for a residence permit card from the Finnish Immigration Service. The residence permit card is proof of your right to reside in Finland.

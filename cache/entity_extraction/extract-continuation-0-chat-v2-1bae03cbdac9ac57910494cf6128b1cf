Will I lose my residence permit? If you have moved to Finland but your company is not in operation, we will ask you about it. In your reply, you can explain your situation and your plans. We will then make an overall assessment of your situation. I have a residence permit for a specialist. How does the Finnish Immigration Service know if I have received benefits or whether or not my salary has been on the level required for the permit? We may conduct register checks in different national registers. Information on the salaries and benefits paid to you comes from, among other sources, the Incomes Register. Your salary must meet the salary requirement of the year during which your residence permit was issued. You can read more about the Incomes Register on the website of the Finnish Tax Administration: Incomes Register (vero. fi).

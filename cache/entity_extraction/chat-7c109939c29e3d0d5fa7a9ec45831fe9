The number of days of annual holidays an employee is entitled to depends on when the contract of employment started and how many years the employee has worked there. On average, employees accrue from 2 to 2. 5 days of annual holidays for each month worked. Annual holidays are paid, and you will also receive a holiday bonus period before or after the holiday. In addition to paid holidays, you can apply for unpaid leave. In Finland, holidays are long compared to many other countries. Most employers also value work-life balance and want employees to take their holidays regularly. In Finland, the common belief is that employees do their job better if they get some rest from time to time.\r\n######################\r\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

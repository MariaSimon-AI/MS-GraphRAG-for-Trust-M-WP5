If you do not have a bank account, your pay can also be loaded onto a prepaid card. In this case, ask your reception centre for instructions for your employer. Work Studies Work and study activities organised by reception centres Work During registration, the police or border control authority will provide you with a printed certificate (pdf) proving your right to work. The certificate is called certificate of a pending application. Your right to work is unrestricted, meaning that you can find employment in any field. Keep the copy of the certificate you receive for yourself. If you have already applied for temporary protection but have not received a certificate of a pending application (pdf) from the police or border control authority, we can send you the certificate by email. Send your request for the certificate to migri@migri. fi. If you don't yet have employment and have no need for a certificate, you can simply wait for the decision on your application. The decision on temporary protection will state that you have an unrestricted right to work. You will also receive a residence permit card stating that you have an unrestricted right to work. The Finnish Immigration Service aims to issue the decision quickly and without undue delay.

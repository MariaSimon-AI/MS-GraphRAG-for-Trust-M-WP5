The waiting period is three months if you have presented a valid passport or other travel document to the authorities, and it has been verified as genuine. The waiting period is six months if you have not presented a travel document. If you submitted a re-application before 1 June 2019, you may continue working. How long can the employment continue? When you receive a decision, you must check whether your right to work is still valid. The decision will tell you this. Was your asylum application accepted?

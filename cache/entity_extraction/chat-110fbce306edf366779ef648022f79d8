If you are applying for an extended permit on the basis of work, you should apply approximately 2 months before your current residence permit expires. If you have a residence permit for studies, do not apply for an extended permit before you have completed the necessary ECTS credits. You may legally reside in Finland during the processing of your application and the possible appeal process. If you receive a negative extended permit decision and a decision on your removal from the country, you must leave Finland.

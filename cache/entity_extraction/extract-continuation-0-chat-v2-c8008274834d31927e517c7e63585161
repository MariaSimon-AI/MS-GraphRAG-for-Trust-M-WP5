We process the majority of applications within the expected time. You can find the expected processing time of your application on the page that contains information about that application, and in the Processing Time Checker. You are most likely to get a decision on your application within the expected processing time if you fill in your application carefully and make sure it has all the necessary attachments. You should not compare your processing time to the processing time of other applicants, because the processing time varies depending on the amount of investigation needed for each application. The processing time may be longer if:we need to ask you for further informationyou have not filled in your application sufficientlywe need to invite you to an interviewyou have requested that we make an exception to the requirements that you should meet in order to get the permit Other Finnish authorities are sometimes involved in the processing of applications. This may also make the processing time longer. For example, we may need a partial decision from an Employment and Economic Development Office (TE Office), or a Finnish mission (embassy or consulate) may need to interview you. The Finnish Immigration Service cannot influence the length of the waiting times of other authorities. If your employer needs to add your terms of employment to the application The calculation of the processing time begins when your employer has supplemented your application by filling in your terms of employment.

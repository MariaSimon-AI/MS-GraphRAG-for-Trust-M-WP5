How can I make them smaller? You can reduce the file size of your documents when scanning them. In the scanner settings, select 150 dpi as resolution, for instance. Resolution regulates the level of detail in the scanned image. If the attachment is an image, you can reduce its size by opening the file in an image processing programme, reduce the size of the image and then save the file again. How can I expedite an application so that it will be processed urgently? Read more about requests to expedite on the website migri. fi. Messages from the online service I received an automatic message from Enter Finland. When does Enter Finland send automatic messages, and can I stop them? A notification is sent by email and text message in the following situations: 1) A request for additional information has been sent to you. 2) You have been sent a decision to read. 3) The additional information you submitted has been received. 4) Your reply to a request for additional information has been received. 5) A status message is sent to you every three weeks (residence permit applications) or every three months (citizenship applications) until a decision has been made on the application. Automatic messages cannot be turned off. I did not receive an automatic message when I was supposed to. For example I didn't receive a message when I replied to a supplement request.\r\n######################\r\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

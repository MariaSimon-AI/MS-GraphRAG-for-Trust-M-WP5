Can I still register for the remigration queue? The remigration queue was closed on 1 July 2011. It is no longer possible to register for the remigration queue. I am an Ingrian Finn. Can I apply for a residence permit on the basis of remigration? The remigration system for Ingrian Finnish returnees ended on 1 July 2016. You may apply for a residence permit as an Ingrian Finnish returnee only if you belong to the Ingrian evacuees or if you served in the Finnish army. In other cases, you may apply for a residence permit through the general residence permit system in Finland (studying, employment, family ties in Finland). I am an Ingrian Finn and was granted a first residence permit on the basis of remigration. Now my spouse is moving to Finland. Does he or she need to have secure means of support? If you have been granted a residence permit on the basis of remigration, your family may usually apply for a residence permit on the basis of family ties.\r\n######################\r\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\r\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\r\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,product,law,concept,health,finance,time,policy,technology,other]\r\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\r\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\r\n \r\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\r\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\r\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\r\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\r\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\r\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\r\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\r\n \r\n3.

You can only apply for an extended permit in Finland. If you submit your residence permit application abroad at a Finnish mission, it will be processed as a new application for a first residence permit. If you are required to have a visa, it is possible that you will not be issued a visa to return to Finland. The Finnish mission makes the decision to grant a visa. I would like to travel in Finland for a short time after the expiry of my residence permit. Should I apply for a new permit or what should I do? If you are a foreign national free of visa you may stay in Finland and Schengen area for a maximum period of 90 days. Other foreign nationals must leave Finland when the residence permit expires. Residence permits cannot be granted for holiday travel. I have applied for a residence permit but I have not yet received a decision. I will soon be travelling abroad for a holiday. Can I speed up the processing of my application? No. A trip or a family visit abroad is not a well-founded reason for expediting an application. Read more about expedited processing. End of employment I have been granted a residence permit for employment but have become unemployed. How will this affect my residence permit? You have been granted a permit to reside in Finland on the basis of employment. If you no longer are employed, such grounds no longer exist\r\n######################\r\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

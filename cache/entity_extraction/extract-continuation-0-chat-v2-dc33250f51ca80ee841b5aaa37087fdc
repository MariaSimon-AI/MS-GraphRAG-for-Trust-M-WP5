If you apply for Finnish citizenship and there are no children under 18 years of age as your co-applicants, you may avoid having to visit a service point. Read more on the page Identification. When you submit your application via the online service Enter Finland, you must prove your identity at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service or, if you are abroad, at a Finnish mission (embassy or consulate). During the same visit, you must present the originals of the documents that you have attached to your application, and possibly give your fingerprints for a residence permit card. You must prove your identity at a service point in Finland or at a Finnish mission abroad within 3 months of submitting your application in Enter Finland. What will happen if I do not use strong identification? If you do not use strong identification, you will have to visit a service point to prove your identity. In contrast, if you are using strong identification, you are not always required to visit a service point. By using strong identification, you will likely save time.\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

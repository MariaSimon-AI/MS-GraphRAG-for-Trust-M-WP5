In addition, you need to submit a certificate that states the level of your speaking and comprehension skills in the Finnish or Swedish language (on the scale of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) or a certificate showing that you have regularly participated in studies in the Finnish or Swedish language. Read more about requesting an exception to the language skills requirement. 29. I would like to request an exception to the language skills requirement because of my illness. What documents do I need to provide? Ask a doctor who is treating you to issue a certificate in which the doctor states whether your illness or disability is such that it permanently prevents you from acquiring the required language skills.

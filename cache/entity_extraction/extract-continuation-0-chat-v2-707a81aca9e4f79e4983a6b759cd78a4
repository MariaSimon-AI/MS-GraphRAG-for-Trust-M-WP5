I got to know my spouse when he or she lived in Germany. We did not begin our relationship at this point. We got married after my spouse had moved back to Finland. Can I get a residence card when I move to join him or her in Finland? You cannot get a residence card for a family member of an EU citizen, because your family was only formed after your spouse returned to Finland after he or she had resided in another EU country. The relationship that led to your spouse becoming your family member did not begin when you were living in Germany. Instead of a residence card, you can apply for a residence permit as a spouse of a Finnish citizen. I am an EU citizen. If I already have been granted a personal identity code by the Local Register Office do I also have to apply for registration of the right of residence at the Finnish Immigration Service? Yes you do. If you stay in Finland for over three months without a break, you have to register your right of residence. It is not only enough to be granted a personal identity code but you also have to apply for a registration certificate of your right of residence in the EU at the Finnish Immigration Service.

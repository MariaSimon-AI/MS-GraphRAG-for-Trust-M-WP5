For each identified entity, extract the following information:\r\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\r\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,product,law,concept,health,finance,time,policy,technology,other]\r\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\r\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\r\n \r\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\r\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\r\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\r\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\r\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\r\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\r\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\r\n \r\n3.

On a case-to-case basis, the Finnish Immigration Service may grant permission to gain access to a secret document for purposes of scientific research, statistical compilations or the preparation of official plans or studies, if it is obvious that access will not violate the interests protected by the secrecy provision.\nIf you wish to gain access to confidential information for the purpose of scientific research, you need to apply for a research permit. The application must contain your basic details and specify, in as much detail as possible, which information you need and for what purpose. Your application must contain a research plan in which you describe what data you need and why.\nThe Finnish Immigration Service will decide whether a research permit can be granted. When evaluating the research permit application, the Finnish Immigration Service will consider the freedom of science, the legal basis for granting a research permit, the legislation governing the disclosure of data, and the appropriateness of granting a research permit\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

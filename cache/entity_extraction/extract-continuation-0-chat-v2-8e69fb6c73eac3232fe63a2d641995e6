Text: In addition, there are other entities such as \"trafficking\" (concept), \"exploitation\" (concept), \"victim's rights\" (concept), \"trafficking network\" (organization), and \"trafficker\" (person). The relationship between these entities is that human trafficking involves exploiting a person for the purpose of forced labor, sexual exploitation, or organ removal. Traffickers often operate in networks and use various methods to control their victims, such as threats, violence, and debt bondage. Victims of human trafficking have certain rights, including the right to be protected from further harm, the right to receive medical care, and the right to be reunited with their families if possible. The assistance system for victims of human trafficking helps victims exercise these rights by providing them with legal advice, interpretation and translation services, and other necessary support.\n\n  3. Text: Furthermore, there are also entities such as \"trafficking victim identification\" (event), \"trafficking investigation\" (event), and \"trafficking prosecution\" (event). The relationship between these entities is that identifying victims of human trafficking is an important step in investigating and prosecuting traffickers. This can be done by law enforcement agencies, social services, or healthcare providers who come into contact with potential victims. Once a victim has been identified, they may be interviewed to gather evidence against the trafficker. If there is enough evidence, the case will be forwarded to the prosecutor for further action. The assistance system for victims of human trafficking can also play a role in the identification and investigation process by providing support to victims and helping them access services that can assist with their recovery.", "input": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

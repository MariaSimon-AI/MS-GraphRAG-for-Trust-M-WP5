The category ‘unspecified’ is visible on the front page under nationality, gender, and age group when no customer group, such as residence permits, has been selected. Decisions – International protection – Asylum applications Positive, explanations Asylum An asylum seeker is given refugee status if he or she is granted asylum. Subsidiary protection If the requirements for granting asylum are not met, the Finnish Immigration Service may grant a residence permit based on subsidiary protection. In this case, the asylum seeker is given subsidiary protection status. Humanitarian protection Until 16 May 2016, Finland was able to grant asylum seekers humanitarian protection if the requirements for granting asylum or subsidiary protection were not met. As of 16 May 2016, this type of international protection no longer exists due to an amendment to the Aliens Act. Others Others includes the following types of decisions:residence permits granted in cases of obstacles to leaving the countryresidence permits granted on a discretionary basis on humanitarian groundsresidence permits granted to victims of human trafficking. If an asylum seeker has submitted a separate residence permit application and a decision on that application has been made at the same time as on the asylum application, also the residence permit decision will be included in these statistics.

In some cases, you need to have the documents attached to your application translated and legalised. Interpretation If you are applying for asylum in Finland and need an interpreter at your asylum interview, the Finnish Immigration Service will provide one for you. You do not need to pay for the interpretation. If you are applying for another type of permit, such as a residence permit or EU registration, you must pay the interpreterâ€™s fee yourself. If you are in Finland, the Finnish Immigration Service makes the necessary arrangements for an interpreter to be present at your interview. If you are abroad, the arrangements are made by the Finnish mission. Your interview invitation contains more detailed instructions. It is possible that you will not be interviewed at all. The decision as to whether you will be invited to take part in an interview is made during the processing of your application. Translations If the documents attached to your application are written in a language other than Finnish, Swedish or English, you must have them translated by an authorised translator (search engine available in Finnish and Swedish) or by a translator who is considered to be an official translator by another EU Member State. You can ask the Finnish mission in your country of residence whether they know of any authorised translators in that country. You may have your documents translated by a translator who is not an authorised translator but in that case you need to have the translation legalised.

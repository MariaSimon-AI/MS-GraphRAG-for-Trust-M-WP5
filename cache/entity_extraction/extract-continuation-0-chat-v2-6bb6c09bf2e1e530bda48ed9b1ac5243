Some application forms ask for a family identification code. With the help of the code, applications can become pending automatically and be linked together in our system when family members are applying for a permit at the same time. You can get a family identification code only if you have stated in your application that your family member is applying for a residence permit at the same time as you. Include the email address of your family member in your application, and we will send the code to the email address. When your family member has received the code, he or she has to include it in his or her own application. The family identification code is not mandatory. You can submit your application without a code. Submitting your application without a code will not delay the processing of your application. How can I make sure that the document I sent to you in Enter Finland has been received? You can be sure that we have received your documents if the application events show that the reply has been sent and if the application attachments contain the documents you have sent. According to Enter Finland, the processing ground of my application has been changed. What does it mean? Choosing the right application form can sometimes be difficult. For example, if an applicant who has applied for a residence permit for an employed person could get a residence permit as a specialist, we will process the application according to the processing ground where the waiting time is shorter and the decision more likely to be positive. However, this change is made only\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. ALHAMIA PRISON (geo) - Prison in Tiruzia\n2.

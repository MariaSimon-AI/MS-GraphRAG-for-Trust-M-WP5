Assistance and donations Transportation Offering accommodation Assistance and donations I would like to organise a collection or donate clothing, toys or other items to those arriving from Ukraine. Who should I contact? The primary way to offer your help is to contact reliable volunteer organisations, for example. Many organisations have organised their own collections. However, if you want to donate items directly to a reception centre, contact your local reception centre before bringing any donations. For contact details of reception centres, see the page Reception centres. The reception centre will tell you whether any items and goods are needed at the moment. The reception centre will also give you more detailed instructions on what type of items are welcome. Please make sure that the donated items are in good condition and sorted out beforehand. Any items you donate to a reception centre are intended for all clients of the reception centre. Transportation I will be offering transportation to Finland for Ukrainians who have fled the Russian military attack. Who should I contact? We are asking all voluntary transport organisers providing transport for Ukrainian nationals from Ukraine to Finland to submit preliminary passenger information to the Finnish Immigration Service. Be prepared to provide the following information:How many Ukrainians are arriving by your transportation? Report the number of passengers only. Do not provide any personal details on this form. What is the final destination of the passenger in Finland? Will the persons stay in Finland visa-free or will they apply for asylum? If the persons are applying for asylum, will they be staying at a reception\r\n######################\r\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

You have sufficient financial resources for the entire validity period of your residence permit.\nYou may work in paid employment or pursue a trade or business without establishing a company. Your main source of income must be the work for which you are applying for a residence permit.\nIf your main source of income is paid employment, your salary must be at least the minimum specified in the relevant collective agreement. If there is no collective agreement in your sector or if you will be working part-time, your salary must be at least EUR 1,399 per month in 2024. If your main source of income is pursuing a trade or business, or if you are combining paid employment and pursuing a trade or business, you must make at least EUR 1,399 per month in 2024.\nSome of your salary may consist of fringe benefits, such as company car or employer-provided accommodation.

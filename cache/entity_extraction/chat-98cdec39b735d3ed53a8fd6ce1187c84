At which stage of processing is my application at the moment? If you submitted an online application, you can check the processing stage of your application in Enter Finland. You can follow the processing queue of residence permit applications or use the Processing Time Checker to check the expected processing time for your application. Why does the processing of paper applications take longer? Your application is pending when you have submitted the application and the necessary attachments and given your fingerprints at a Finnish mission or at a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service. The mission will send the paper application to Finland by courier. It may take several weeks for the application to arrive in Finland. Therefore, it takes much longer to process a paper application. When will the decision be made? Can I or my educational institution expedite the decision? You or your educational institution cannot expedite the decision. Please fill in the application carefully and attach all the necessary attachments to the application. Missing information will delay the processing of the application. You cannot speed up the processing of your matter by calling, e-mailing or visiting a service point. We will contact you if we need more information for your application.\nInformation on the current processing situation and average processing times can be found on the page Processing times. I have submitted an online application. How will I be informed of the decision? When your application has been processed, you will receive the decision to your Enter Finland account.

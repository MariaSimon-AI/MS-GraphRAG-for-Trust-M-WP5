A person who studies abroad and carries out an internship in Finland is considered a trainee and not a student. If you want to come to Finland for an internship, you should apply for a residence permit for an internship.\n9. A residence permit can be issued for studies other than those leading to a degree or a vocational qualification on reasonable grounds which include: further studies to supplement vocational skills or degrees already acquired, further training relating to work done in the country of departure, special training to be acquired in Finland, student exchange, Finnish ancestry, language or other training preceding studies (e.g., a Finnish language course when the applicant has been accepted as a student in an educational institution and these studies lead to a degree or a vocational qualification).\n10. The extent of the insurance coverage required depends on the duration of your studies. An exchange student will, therefore, need a more comprehensive insurance than students studying for a degree. If you are studying for a degree and some of the studies will be completed in another country, you will need a more comprehensive insurance.\n11.

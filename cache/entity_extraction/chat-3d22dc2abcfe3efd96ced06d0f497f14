The Finnish Immigration Service makes the projections in cooperation with different interest groups, and is responsible for coordinating the work of the foresight network. The network’s operations are directed by an inter-administrative steering group consisting of different authorities. The Finnish Immigration Service’s foresight network updated its estimates for 2024 and 2025 in February 2024. The forecasts are updated three times a year and published on the website of the Finnish Immigration Service. This page was last updated on 20 March 2024. Need for temporary protection will continue in the coming years The volume of applications for temporary protection has been decreasing since the autumn of 2023. The weekly number of applications has been well below 200 in early 2024. Despite the decrease, applications are still being submitted regularly. According to the updated forecast of the foresight network, 8,000–12,000 applicants for temporary protection will arrive in Finland in 2024. According to the forecast, the number of applications submitted in 2025 will be 5,000–10,000. The number of applicants arriving from Ukraine depends on factors\r\n######################\r\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

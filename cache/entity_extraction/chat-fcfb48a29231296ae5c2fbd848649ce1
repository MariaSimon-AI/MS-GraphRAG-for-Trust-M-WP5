Employer certification is intended for employers whose employees are applying for a residence permit on the basis of work.\nWhen a company applies for employer certification, the company’s ability to meet its obligations as an employer will be assessed. Once the certification has been granted, a separate assessment will not be required when individual residence permit applications are processed.

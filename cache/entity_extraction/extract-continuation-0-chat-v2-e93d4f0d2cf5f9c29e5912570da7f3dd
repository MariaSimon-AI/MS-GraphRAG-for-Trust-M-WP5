If you obtain a new passport that is issued by your country of nationality, visit a service point of the Finnish Immigration Service to present your new passport there. Your valid refugee travel document or alien’s passport will then be withdrawn. Please note:You may lose your refugee status or subsidiary protection status if the authorities of your country of nationality extend the validity period of your passport or if you obtain a new passport that is issued by your country of nationality. Travelling Check with the authorities of your country of destination to find out if an alien’s passport or a refugee travel document allows you to travel to that country. Finnish authorities, such as the Finnish Immigration Service, do not decide to which countries you may or may not travel with an alien’s passport or a refugee travel document. When you depart from or return to Finland, you must have a valid travel document and a valid residence permit card.

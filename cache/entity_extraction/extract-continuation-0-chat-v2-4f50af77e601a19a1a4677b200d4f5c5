The permit may be granted only to other relatives of a Finnish citizen or a person who has received international protection. If the close family life of the applicant and of the relative living in Finland has previously been discontinued for normal family reasons – for example, when an adult child has begun family life with his or her spouse – the residence permit may not be granted on the grounds of resuming close family life. Residence permits are primarily intended to be granted on the above grounds if an elderly parent moves to Finland at the same time as his or her adult child. If the application for a residence permit is submitted after the adult child has moved to Finland, the discontinuation of family life must have taken place for compelling reasons, such as for living in exile as a refugee. Even in such cases the efforts to resume the close family life must begin immediately after the adult child has arrived in Finland and established contact with the relative. A permit may also be granted if the close relative is fully dependent on the person residing in Finland. Dependence on a person (sponsor) residing in Finland refers to both physical and mental dependence; financial dependence alone does not constitute full dependence.

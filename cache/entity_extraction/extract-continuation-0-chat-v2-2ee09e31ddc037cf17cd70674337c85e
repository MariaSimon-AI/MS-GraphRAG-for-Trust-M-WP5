{"result": " Entities: Oulu (geo), 2023 (time), 9405 (number), 130 (number), foreigners (organization)\n   Relationships: residing_in (Oulu, foreigners), increasing (foreigners), established (international connections), through (sea trade), centuries (time)\n\n   Note that the relationships are between the entities and not necessarily between the extracted numbers or dates. For example, \"residing\\_in\" is a relationship between the city of Oulu and the foreigners organization, not between the number 9405 and the city of Oulu. Similarly, \"increasing\" is a relationship between the foreigners organization and time, not between the number 130 and the foreigners organization.\n\n   Also note that the relationships are directional, meaning that they indicate a specific flow or connection between entities. For example, \"residing\\_in\" indicates that the foreigners reside in Oulu, not the other way around. Similarly, \"established\" indicates that international connections were established by the city of Oulu and its inhabitants, not the other way around.\n\n   Finally, note that the relationships are not necessarily causal or temporal. For example, just because the foreigners are increasing does not mean that they are causing the increase in population, and just because the international connections have been established for centuries does not mean that they were established before the year 2023. The relationships simply indicate a connection between entities, without implying any specific cause or order of events.", "input": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

Regardless of the type of residence permit (A, B or P) or the reasons why it was granted, a Finnish residence permit allows you to visit other countries in the Schengen area for no more than 90 days at a time. This is the longest total consecutive time you may spend outside Finland in other Schengen countries, not just in one country. I have a permanent residence permit issued by another Schengen country. Does this allow me to live and work in Finland? A residence permit issued by another Schengen country allows you to travel to Finland for a period of no more than 90 days at a time. If you do not have a residence permit issued by Finland, you may not stay any longer than that, and you may not take paid employment. Work for which a residence permit is not required is an exception to this rule. May I change from one occupational sector to another while my residence permit for an employed person is valid? Your residence permit for an employed person entitles you to work in any or several occupations of your choosing. For more information, see Changing jobs. Can I move from one professional field to another while my residence permit for an employed person is valid? Your residence permit for an employed person entitles you to work in one or more professional fields, depending on the number of professional fields for which you have\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

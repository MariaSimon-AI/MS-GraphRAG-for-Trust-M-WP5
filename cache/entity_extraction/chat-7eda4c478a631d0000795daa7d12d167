Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\r\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\r\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,product,law,concept,health,finance,time,policy,technology,other]\r\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\r\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\r\n \r\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\r\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\r\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\r\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\r\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\r\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\r\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\r\n \r\n3.

If such decision has been made and it is still valid when a foreign national applies for a residence permit on the basis of work in the service of that employer, the employee will receive a negative decision on the application. A decision to refrain from issuing permits is valid for three to twelve months. The decision on refraining from issuing permits may be appealed against by the employer.\nEmployers of people who apply for a residence permit on the basis of work A decision to refrain from issuing permits may be made if the employer has given false or misleading information on, for instance, the collective agreement applicable to an employee’s employment relationship, on the employer's ability to meet their obligations as an employer, or on the principal terms of work. The principal terms of work include: the employee's main duties; the grounds for the determination of pay, and the pay period; the working hours to be observed; the professional field in which the employee will work. A decision to refrain from issuing permits may be made if the information that the employer has given is clearly false or highly misleading and if the employer has not corrected\r\n######################\r\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

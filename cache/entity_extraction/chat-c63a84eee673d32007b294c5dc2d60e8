The relationships between the entities are as follows:\n   - Firuzabad negotiated a hostage exchange with Aurelia (Durke Bataglani and Meggie Tazbah were hostages in Firuzabad).\n   - Quintara brokered the hostage exchange between Firuzabad and Aurelia (Durke Bataglani, Meggie Tazbah, and Samuel Namara were exchanged in the same hostage release).\n   - Samuel Namara was a prisoner at Alhamia prison.\n3. The action to be taken is: Employers must submit their employee’s terms of employment when the employee applies for a first residence permit and when the employee applies for an extended permit using Enter Finland for Employers. The employee should enter the employer's Business ID in his or her application, which links the company to the employee’s application. Once submitted, the employer can add any required attachments. If the employee is applying for a residence permit for a researcher, for seasonal work, or for a residence permit on the basis of intra-corporate transfer, the employer should first be given permission to supplement the application by the employee. This permission can be given in the 'Employment details' section when filling out the application. If multiple employees have similar terms of employment and are using similar residence permit applications, the employer can fill in the terms of employment for all employees at once in Enter Finland.\n4.

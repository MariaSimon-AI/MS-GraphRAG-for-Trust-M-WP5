Is the passing of a maturity test as part of a higher education degree considered sufficient demonstration of language skills? Yes, it is sufficient if you took the maturity test in Finnish or Swedish. 25. Can I demonstrate my language proficiency using a type of language certificate that is not mentioned on the website of the Finnish Immigration Service? No. Language proficiency can only be demonstrated with one of the certificates listed on our website. 26. How can a 15-year-old who has not yet completed comprehensive education demonstrate his or her language skills? In that case, the applicant can attach to the application the most recent school report that shows the grade awarded in the Finnish or Swedish language. 27. I have completed compulsory basic education and/or upper secondary education in Sweden. Can a certificate of Swedish basic education or upper secondary education be used to demonstrate that I meet the language skills requirement? No, it cannot. You can demonstrate that you meet the language skills requirement by submitting a Finnish comprehensive school or upper secondary school leaving certificate showing that you have passed the examination in Finnish or Swedish as your native language or as a second language. If you have completed basic education or upper secondary education in Sweden, we would advise you to obtain the National Certificate of Language Proficiency (YKI) or the Civil Service Language Proficiency Certificate, for example.

No, you cannot. You can apply for reception allowance in Finland only if you also apply for temporary protection in Finland. Please note that you cannot be granted temporary protection in more than one EU country at a time. If you are granted a residence permit in Finland on the basis of temporary protection, your temporary protection residence permit in another EU country will be cancelled. What happens if you are granted temporary protection but have also applied for asylum? If you have applied for asylum and are granted temporary protection, the Finnish Immigration Service will suspend the processing of your asylum application for as long as the residence permit you have been issued on the basis of temporary protection is valid. When will the Finnish Immigration Service resume the processing of your asylum application? When your residence permit issued on the basis of temporary protection expires, you will receive a letter from the Finnish Immigration Service asking if you wish for the processing of your asylum application to resume. If you want the Finnish Immigration Service to resume the processing of your asylum application, inform the agency of this by the specified deadline. The Finnish Immigration Service will then process your application in accordance with the normal asylum examination process. Learn more about applying for asylum.

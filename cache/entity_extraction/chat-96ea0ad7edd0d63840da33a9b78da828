Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\r\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\r\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,product,law,concept,health,finance,time,policy,technology,other]\r\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\r\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\r\n \r\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\r\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\r\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\r\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\r\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\r\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\r\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\r\n \r\n3.

Submit the application when you meet all the requirements and have the required attachments. The decision may be negative if you do not meet the requirements or if a mandatory attachment is missing. 10. How does time spent abroad affect the period of residence? In total, you can spend 365 days outside Finland during the required period of residence. Up to 90 of these days can be from the one-year period preceding the citizenship decision. If you spend more time abroad, the exceeding days will not be counted towards your period of residence. If you exceed the maximum number of days abroad, this will postpone the day when you will meet the period of residence requirement. For example: If your required period of residence is 5 years and you get a decision on 1 July 2025, we will count the days you have spent abroad between 1 July 2020 and 1 July 2025. If you have been abroad for a maximum of 365 days, the days abroad will be accepted as part of your period of residence. During one year immediately before the decision, which in this example would be 1 July 2024–1 July 2025, a maximum of 90 days abroad are accepted as part of your period of residence. The day when you leave Finland and the day when you return to Finland will be counted towards your period of residence. 11. Will the trips abroad that I have made after submitting the application be counted as residence outside Finland? Yes\r\n######################\r\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

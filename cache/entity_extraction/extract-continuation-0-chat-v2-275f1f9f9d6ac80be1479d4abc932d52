How do you register an EU citizen’s child who was born in Finland? You apply for a registration certificate for the child on the basis of family ties. To do this you have to fill in a separate EU_REK form for the child. At least one of the guardians has to be present when submitting the paper application or when proving the child’s identity after submitting the application in the e-service. If both of the guardians are not personally present, you have to get a written consent to the application from the other guardian. The child has to have an own valid passport or identity card.

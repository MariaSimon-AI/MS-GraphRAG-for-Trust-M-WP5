A visa is a permit to enter the country for a short-term or temporary period of residence lasting no more than 90 days. If you intend to reside in Finland for other purposes, you have to apply for a residence permit. You will not need a visa if you are a citizen of a Nordic country or an EU Member State. Similarly, no visa is required if you are a citizen of a visa-free country and you have a valid passport or a comparable travel document. When you wish to stay in Finland for over 90 days, you need to apply for a first residence permit abroad and wait for the decision there before you come to Finland. If you visit Finland while your residence permit application is still pending, you must travel back to your home country when your visa-free period ends or when your visa expires. Applications for a first residence permit can be submitted in Finland only in certain exceptional situations. Read more about how to apply for a first residence permit.\nDo you have questions about travelling? Please see the frequently asked questions and the instructions on the website of the Finnish Border Guard. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is responsible for visas You may apply for a visa outside Finland from a Finnish embassy operating under the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland. Finnish embassies also make decisions on the granting\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

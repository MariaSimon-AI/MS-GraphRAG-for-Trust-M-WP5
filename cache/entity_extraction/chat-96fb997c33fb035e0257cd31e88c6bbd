Reception allowance is money intended for the immediate basic needs of you and your family. You can be granted reception allowance if you or your family members do not have enough income and funds to cover your immediate basic needs, such as food and clothing. Reception allowance is not granted automatically. You can apply for the allowance from your own reception centre by filling in an application form. Your reception centre can give you the application form and instructions for applying. The reception allowance consists of the basic component and the supplementary reception allowance. The basic component of the reception allowance is intended for clothing, minor health care costs, expenses on the use of local transport, and telephone costs, for example. The basic component is also intended for food costs if the reception centre does not offer daily meals. In addition to the basic component, you can apply for supplementary reception allowance for the special needs of you and your family. Your income and funds affect the amount of your reception allowance All income and funds that you and your family have at your disposal affect the amount of the reception allowance. Even all income and funds you receive from abroad affect the amount of the reception allowance, if you have the income and funds at your disposal in Finland. When you apply for the reception allowance, you have a legal obligation to report to the reception centre all your income and funds. Income means any monetary income, such as salary or wages,\r\n######################\r\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

Your insurance must be valid when you arrive in Finland. The required amount of insurance depends on the duration of your studies in Finland. If your studies in Finland take less than 2 years (less than 4 semesters), your insurance must cover medical expenses up to EUR 120,000. If your studies in Finland take at least 2 years, your insurance must cover pharmaceutical expenses up to EUR 40,000. Read more on the page Insurances. How much money do I need for living in Finland? You need to have at least 560 euros per month at your disposal to be able to pay for your accommodation, food and other needs. In your application, provide documentation proving that you have sufficient funds to live in Finland for the first year of the validity of the extended permit. A deposit in a Finnish bank account is the easiest and most reliable way to show that you have sufficient financial resources. If your educational institution supports your living in Finland, you do not necessarily need to have 560 euros per month at your disposal. When applying for an extended permit, your income from work can also be taken into account. Read more on the page Income requirement for students. How can I change my B permit to an A permit?

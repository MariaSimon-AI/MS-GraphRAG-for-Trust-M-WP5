Your income and funds affect the amount of your reception allowance All income and funds that you and your family have at your disposal affect the amount of the reception allowance. Even all income and funds you receive from abroad affect the amount of the reception allowance, if you have the income and funds at your disposal in Finland. When you apply for the reception allowance, you have a legal obligation to report to the reception centre all your income and funds. Income means any monetary income, such as salary or wages, tax refunds or money gifted to you by a relative, for example. Funds can mean, for instance, cash, savings in a bank account or any assets and property of value that you can sell. The amount of the reception allowance is always determined individually on the basis of the needs and funds of the person or family. Your reception centre will make a calculation of the amount of reception allowance you are entitled to. Your income and the funds you have at your disposal will be taken into account in the calculation. Under law, a maximum of 150 euros of your wage income may be excluded from the calculation, meaning that this sum does not reduce the amount of your reception allowance. The rest of your wage income will still affect the amount of the reception allowance. Under law, a maximum of 50 euros of other income than wage income may also be excluded from the calculation, meaning that this sum does not reduce the amount of your reception allowance. For a family, the corresponding sum is 100 euros.\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

We cannot send application papers as it is not possible to apply from abroad by post or e-mail. Read more about applying for asylum. What does tracing mean? Tracing is carried out to re-establish the connection between a minor who is seeking asylum and his or her parent or guardian who is residing outside Finland. The information gathered through tracing is important for decision-making and can later help reunite the family. Tracing is always carried out taking into account the best interest of the child. It is usually in the best interest of the child to know where his or her parents or guardians are. According to the Aliens Act, measures must be taken to trace the parents or some other persons responsible for the actual custody of an unaccompanied minor whenever possible. What is meant by age determination and why is this necessary for an asylum seeker? Age assessment is an important part of establishing an asylum seeker’s identity. Some statutory rights and obligations of asylum seekers depend on their age. For example, a child under the age of 18 applying for international protection who does not have a guardian is safeguarded through special arrangements during the asylum process and at the reception centre for asylum seekers.

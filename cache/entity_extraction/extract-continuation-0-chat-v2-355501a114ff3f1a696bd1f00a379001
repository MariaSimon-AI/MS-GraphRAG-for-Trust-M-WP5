If you have an employment relationship in order to pick wild berries, you can apply for a residence permit for an employed person. Employment relationship means that you have an employer with whom you have a contract concerning your work and salary. Read more on the page Residence permit for an employed person. You cannot get a seasonal work permit on the basis of wild-berry picking. Can a seasonal worker have several employers? Yes, it is possible to have more than one employer. Those who will work on berry farms, for example, can sign an employment contract with several companies already before they start working. If you intend to work for several employers, provide the information and attachments on each employer at the application stage. You can supplement your application while it is still being processed by the Finnish Immigration Service. If you get employed by a new employer who is not yet registered in your seasonal work permit, you can apply for the addition of the employer to your permit. You can work for the new employer for as long as your current seasonal work permit is valid. For more information, see: How to apply for the addition of a new employer. If your employment with the new employer will last longer than your seasonal work permit is valid, you must apply for a new residence permit, not the addition of a new employer. Please use the Application Finder to check which permit you should apply for. Does the employer have to pay the minimum wage according to the collective agreement\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

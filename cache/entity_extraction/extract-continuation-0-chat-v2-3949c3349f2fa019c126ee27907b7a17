The reasons behind the expected increase include prolonged conflicts in countries of origin most relevant to Finland and the strained refugee situation within transit countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Libya. However, the control of the internal and external borders of Europe and the geographical distance between Finland and the key entry routes constrain the increase. However, rapid and unexpected changes in the number of applications for international protection are possible. Moreover, the estimate does not take into account asylum applications submitted in Finland as a result of instrumentalisation operations. The number of student applications to Finland is expected to increase in the coming years In 2023, a record number of first-time applications for residence permits on the basis of studies were submitted, totalling 12,867 applications. The forecast network estimates that the number of student applicants will continue to be high. A total of 884 applications were submitted in January–February 2024, corresponding to the number of applications submitted in early 2023. The number of applications is expected to reach 14,000 in 2024 and 15,000 in 2025. The significant increase in applications for student residence permits can be explained by factors such as changes in the legislation on residence permits for students and researchers, as well as an increase in international study programmes and student numbers at higher education institutions. In addition, information about Finland is spread quickly on social media by students already living in the country, making Finland a more attractive place to study.\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

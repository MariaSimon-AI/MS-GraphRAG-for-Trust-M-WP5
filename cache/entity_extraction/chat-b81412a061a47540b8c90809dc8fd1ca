This exchange was brokered by Quintara, an organization, and Firuzabad, another organization. Samuel Namara (PERSON) was also a prisoner at Alhamia prison and was part of the same hostage release as Durke Bataglani, Meggie Tazbah, and possibly others.

The weekly number of applications has been well below 200 in early 2024. Despite the decrease, applications are still being submitted regularly. According to the updated forecast of the foresight network, 8,000–12,000 applicants for temporary protection will arrive in Finland in 2024. According to the forecast, the number of applications submitted in 2025 will be 5,000–10,000. The number of applicants arriving from Ukraine depends on factors such as:the duration and extent of the warthe development of the humanitarian situation in Ukrainethe strain on the reception capacity especially in Ukraine’s neighbouring countries and in the Baltic countries National changes in social security or temporary protection conditions in the main host countries for Ukrainians the number of Ukrainians who move between EU countries. There are considerable uncertainties about the estimated number of applications in 2024–2025, as it is difficult to predict how the war in Ukraine and the resulting refugee situation develop. Temporary protection has been extended by decision of the Council of the European Union until March 2025. Number of asylum applications is expected to increase moderately The future projections of the Finnish Immigration Service do not take a position on the change in the number of asylum seekers as a result of hybrid operations or the instrumentalisation of migrants. The projections for this specific aspect are therefore not included in the current estimates of the number of applications.

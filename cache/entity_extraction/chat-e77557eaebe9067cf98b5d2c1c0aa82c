The income requirement does not apply to all family members. Find out if the income requirement applies to you. Some social benefits are considered income Certain social benefits reduce the amount of financial resources required. These are called ‘social security benefits compensating for expenses’. For example the following benefits belong to this category:child benefitchild care allowancechild maintenance allowancestudy granthousing allowance The person you are dating is not your family member When you apply for a permit on the basis of an established dating relationship or an intention to get married, the income of your partner who lives in Finland is not taken into account because under Finnish law, he or she is not considered to be your family member. The funds you need to have to meet the income requirement (EUR 1,000 per month for one adult) must be freely available to you, for example in your personal bank account.

In that case, you may change jobs if your residence permit is valid and your new work is similar to the work for which your permit was granted. However, you are usually required to apply for a new permit on the basis of your new work if your job description changes. In that case, you are not allowed to start in the new job before you have a new residence permit. If you have been granted a residence permit for a specific task in the service of a specific employer but you want to change jobs, you are usually required to apply for a new residence permit. In that case, your right to work in the new job begins only after you have been granted a new residence permit. One example of situations in which this is required is if you have a residence permit on the basis of intra-corporate transfer. If you have a seasonal work permit and you wish to start working for a new employer, see the page New employer.\r\n######################\r\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

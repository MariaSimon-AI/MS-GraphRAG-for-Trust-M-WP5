Text: Parents who are foreign nationals can apply for Finnish citizenship with their child as a co-applicant if the child is under 18 years of age and they have custody of the child. If the application is successful, the child can become a Finnish citizen at the same time as the parent. The child must live in Finland if the application is made by submitting a citizenship application. If the child is born while the application is pending, the child's application can be added to the parent's application by filling out a supplement form for the child. Normally, a minor child of foreign nationals can only become a Finnish citizen if they are included in the parent's or guardian's citizenship application as a co-applicant. However, children can apply for Finnish citizenship without a parent or guardian if there is a weighty reason related to the best interest of the child. An appointment can be booked to submit the child's application at migri. vihta.com and the child should be present when the form is submitted. A child born in Finland to foreign nationals may become a Finnish citizen based on their place of birth only in exceptional cases.\n3.

Age assessment is an important part of establishing an asylum seeker’s identity. Some statutory rights and obligations of asylum seekers depend on their age. For example, a child under the age of 18 applying for international protection who does not have a guardian is safeguarded through special arrangements during the asylum process and at the reception centre for asylum seekers. More information: Age assessment or establishment of age of a person younger than 18Legislative amendments of 1 September 2024: Switching application procedures I’ve applied for asylum but haven’t received a decision on my application yet. Can I apply for a residence permit on the basis of work or studies while I’m waiting for the asylum decision? If you apply for a residence permit for studies or work, the Finnish Immigration Service will consider your application inadmissible. You cannot get a first residence permit for work, pursuing a trade or studies if you have applied for asylum in Finland and you are staying in Finland. You have to leave Finland and apply for a residence permit for work or studies in your home country or country of permanent residence. If you already have a residence permit in Finland, you can get an extended permit on the basis of work. If you apply for an extended permit on the basis of studies while your asylum application is pending, you will receive a negative decision on your permit application. I have applied for asylum and a residence permit on the basis of work before 1 September\r\n######################\r\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

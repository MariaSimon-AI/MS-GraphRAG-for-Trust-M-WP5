However, the person you are dating can apply for a residence permit on other grounds. Applying for a residence permit You cannot apply for a residence permit on behalf of your family member but you can advise him or her on how to apply. You can also help your family member choose the right application form. If your family member sends us the wrong form or does not fill in the right form properly, the handling of the application will slow down. There are different kinds of forms for applying for a residence permit based on family ties. Your own citizenship or the grounds for your residence permit determine what the right form is. When your family member is applying, you should personally fill in the form for clarification of family ties. Send this form to the applicant so that he or she can attach it to his or her application. Fill in the form in detail. Use full sentences. The application form lists all the attachments your family member has to have when he or she submits the application. Please remember that the certificates you attach to the application must be legalised if they have been issued by an authority (such as marriage and birth certificates). Your family member pays the processing fee in the e-service Enter Finland, at a Finnish mission (embassy or consulate) or the service point of the Finnish Immigration Service, when he or she submits the application.

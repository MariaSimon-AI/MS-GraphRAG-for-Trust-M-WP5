Instead, you will become a resident of the municipality where you live and a client of a wellbeing services county. A wellbeing services county arranges public healthcare, social welfare and rescue services to all residents in the region it serves. When you and your child have a municipality of residence, your child is required to attend a Finnish school. In that case, attending school is compulsory and the school must be part of the Finnish education system. When you have a municipality of residence, a child who is not yet required to go to school is entitled to a place in early childhood education. This is the case even when one or both of the childâ€™s parents are at home and not working or studying. For information on how getting a municipality of residence will affect childcare, school and studies see the website of the Finnish National Agency for Education.

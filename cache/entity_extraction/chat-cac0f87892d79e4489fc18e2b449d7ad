However, this will not apply if your residence permit expires in less than 6 months or if you have been temporarily laid off, and the end date of your lay-off is known. Unemployment will only affect fixed-term permits that have been granted on the basis of employment. If you have a permanent residence permit, it will not be affected by the end of your employment. For more information about residence permits, see the page Residence permit types. If it is found that obtaining a residence permit involved a serious abuse of rights, the withdrawal process may be initiated without delay. Similarly, an EU Blue Card will be cancelled if you no longer have a valid contract for highly qualified employment. However, your card will not be cancelled if you do not have an employment contract that is valid for up to 12 months due to illness, disability, or parental leave, or if you do not meet the income requirement during a period of up to 12 months due to illness, disability, or parental leave. Additionally, your EU Blue Card will not be cancelled if you are unemployed for up to 3 months and have held an EU Blue Card for less than 2 years, or if you are unemployed for up to 6 months and have held an EU Blue Card for more than 2 years but less than 5 years.
